  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER I <br /> GRAY CLOUD MOUNTAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was with feelings of doubt that were not
very far from dismay that Beatrice Deems
watched her new acquaintance, Dan O’Leary,
saddle her recently acquired horse. She had
ridden before, of course, in the tan-bark ring
of the riding-school or on shady bridle-paths
in the park, always on well-broken steeds
whose beauty and grooming were equaled only
by their good manners. But now, as she stood
in her short khaki riding-skirt and her high
boots, waiting outside the great dilapidated
shed that, in this little Montana town, did
duty as a livery-stable, she was beginning to
wonder whether she really knew anything
about horses at all. Certainly she had never
thought of riding anything like this plunging
creature who stood straight up on his hind
legs one moment, then dropped to his forefeet
and stood on them in turn, with the ease
of a circus performer.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had spent only two days in Ely, the
little town planted beside Broken Bow Creek,
in the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains. At
first she had thought that the village, with its
scattered box-like houses and dusty, shadeless
street, was disappointingly unlike the West of
the pictures-books and the movies. The antics
of her new horse, however, were disturbingly
like what she had witnessed in Wild West
shows.</p>

<p class='c004'>“’Name’s Buck,” volunteered the man who
was struggling with the saddle, and added,
though in a tone that seemed to indicate the
explanation as quite unnecessary, “It’s on account
of his color, you know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh!” returned Beatrice, a little blankly.
For the life of her, she could think of nothing
else to say. She had yet to learn that all
Western ponies of that golden buckskin shade
of coat bear the same name. At the moment
she was tempted to believe that the title had
something to do with the way in which the
horse was humping his back like a gigantic cat
and jumping up and down on his nimble white
forefeet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your father went out on the range and
chose the horse himself when he was out here
getting your house ready,” Dan went on.
“He couldn’t have found another pony in the
valley that could go like this one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did he—did he try him?” Beatrice wished
to know.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her feelings in the matter were oddly
mixed, for she dreaded the moment when she
must actually mount to the big, unfamiliar
saddle, and yet she was all on fire to try the
horse’s speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, he didn’t try him,” was the answer.
“He just said he wanted a safe horse for his
daughter, liked the looks of this one—and well
he might,—and took my word for it that the
horse would suit and would go like greased
lightning, besides. There, now, the saddle’s
firm. You mustn’t think anything of the
way he acts when you pull up the cinch; they
all do that!”</p>

<p class='c004'>For all her misgivings, Beatrice was no
coward. She stepped forward, discovered in
one violent second that a Western pony sets
off the moment he feels the rider’s weight on
the stirrup, then flung herself, somehow, into
the saddle and was away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not do that very well,” she was thinking.
“Another time—oh, oh!”</p>

<p class='c004'>For her very thought was interrupted by
the sudden rush of wordless delight as the
horse beneath her stretched himself to that
long easy lope that is like nothing else in the
world. The fresh mountain wind, sweeping
down from the clean, high peaks above, sang
in her ears; the stony road swung past below;
the motion was as easy as a rocking-chair but
seemed as swift as thought itself. Motoring
she had always loved, but she confessed with
sudden disloyalty that it was bumpy business
compared to the measured swaying of this
living creature between her knees. Buck’s
personal prejudices seemed, indeed, to be directed
solely against the cinching of the saddle.
That process once over he was as eager and
happy as she to clatter across the bridge, pass
the last of the ugly little houses and the high-fronted
store buildings, and turn his white-blazed
face toward the mounting trail that led
out of the valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice drew rein when they had breasted
the first rise, and paused a moment to look
back. The houses strewn haphazard across
the slope below her made more of a town than
she had thought. There was the packing-box
railroad station where she and her sister,
Nancy, and their Aunt Anna had arrived so
recently; there was the house where they were
living, a little larger than the others, but
square, hideous, and unshaded like the rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We mustn’t care for architecture,” Nancy
had said when they first surveyed their dwelling
rather ruefully, “when the Rocky Mountains
begin in our back yard.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was also the winding stream with
its abrupt bend that warranted the title of
Broken Bow Creek, a mere trickle of water
just now, in that wide, dry valley down which
the thin line of the railroad stretched away,
with the straight parallel of the rails seeming
to bend and quiver in the hot clearness of the
sunshine. South of the town was a portion of
Ely that she had not seen before, a group of
warehouses, some office buildings, and a huddle
of workmen’s bunk-houses. She could see
the cobweb lines of temporary railroad, a
steam-shovel moving on a flat-car, and innumerable
men toiling like black ants along
the sides of the raw cut that had been made in
the red soil of the valley.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That must be the irrigation ditch that Dan
O’Leary was telling us about,” she reflected.
“How hot it looks down there! I did not
dream they had so many men. And how
clear the air is! Oh, surely, surely, Aunt
Anna will get well here as fast as we hope!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The wind lifted Buck’s yellow mane and her
own brown hair, while the horse pawed the
stony ground impatiently. She let him go
on, for she was in truth as eager as he. This
was the first day that she had found time to
go far from their own house, and she had now
a most fascinating goal before her. What
girl of sixteen would not feel excited over the
prospect of exploring a tract of mountainside
woods of which she was sole owner?</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice had never quite understood how
her father had come to purchase that stretch
of land above Ely; she had not, indeed,
thought to ask. She had come into his study
one Sunday morning when he was going over
his papers and had surprised him with the announcement
that she was sixteen that day.
Having no other present ready, he had brought
out some dusty title-deeds and had made them
over to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will never be of the least use to you, my
dear,” he said, “so do not consider it much of
a present. Twenty-three acres with timber,
cabin, and a waterfall, so the description reads,
but you must not think they are worth anything.
I have never seen the place myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She had believed that it was on account of
this talk about Ely that they thought of the
town again when the doctors had prescribed
for Aunt Anna “a change of climate—some
dry, bracing place in the West.” She was
their only aunt, Mr. Deems’s younger sister,
and she had cared for his household ever since
the death of the two girls’ mother years ago.
She was a slim, frail person of indomitable
spirit, and had begun to look as though she
were far more spirit than body ever since the
influenza epidemic had swept through the
family. Beatrice had always thought that
going to Ely was her own suggestion, though
she could not deny that it was Aunt Anna who
had carried the plan through in the face of
some rather unaccountable opposition from
her father. Mr. Deems had finally given in,
and had made a flying trip to Ely to be sure
that the air and climate were what they
wanted, to choose a house, engage a Chinese
cook, and make all preparations for a summer’s
stay for his sister and the two girls.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not have time to visit your estate on
the hill, Beatrice,” he said on his return.
“You will have to explore it yourself. Dan
O’Leary has charge of it and said he rented
it to some engineers who were surveying the
mountain, but it is unoccupied now. The
place may prove to be a good picnic ground
but I fear it has no other possibilities.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He might say what he chose, Beatrice was
thinking, but he could not destroy her eagerness
to see the place. The trail ran crookedly
upward before her, disappeared in some dense
pine woods, then slanted across the spur of
the mountain and vanished again. Higher
above rose the bare, rocky slopes of the tall
peak that dominated the whole valley, Gray
Cloud Mountain, on one of whose lower,
rugged shoulders lay her land and her cabin.
After climbing for a quarter of a mile, she
was obliged to hesitate at a fork in the way,
uncertain which of the steep paths she was to
take.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little cottage clung to the bare hillside
by the road—a shabby place with no paint
and a patched roof. The door was swinging
open as she passed and a man just going in,
a short-set, foreign-looking person, who
scowled at her over his shoulder when she asked
the way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That one,” he said briefly, pointing to the
right-hand fork and speaking with a heavy
foreign accent. “Up toward John Herrick’s
house, only not so far.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He went in and shut the door abruptly.
Beatrice could hear his voice inside calling
roughly, “Christina, Christina!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He had a roll of large papers in his hand,
posters that he had evidently been putting up
along the way, for she had observed them on
trees and fence-posts nearer town. They
seemed to announce a meeting of some sort,
with English words at the top and odd foreign
printing at the bottom in more than one
language. She had felt a hot flash of indignant
anger at the man’s surly tone, but in a
moment she had forgotten him completely, as
she and Buck went scrambling up the steep
and difficult road.</p>

<p class='c004'>She came at last to a tiny bridge. Broken
Bow Creek, which was little more than a series
of pools in the parched stream-bed in the valley,
was here a singing rivulet, flowing below
the rude crossing amid a group of silvery
aspen-trees. At the left of the trail she could
see a gate, a set of bars hung between two
rough posts. It was with a beating heart that
she dismounted to take them down for Buck
to pass. Once inside she would be on her own
ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>The agility of a mountain-bred pony was so
new to her that she was much astonished, after
she had removed two of the bars, to have Buck
step over the remaining three as neatly as a
dog would have done. She slipped into the
saddle again, making a greater success than at
the first attempt, and followed the nearly invisible
path. The huge straight pine-trees
stood in uneven ranks all about her, their
branches interweaving overhead, the ground
covered with their red-brown needles that muffled
the sound of the horse’s hoofs. Up they
went, with the splash of falling water sounding
louder and ever louder. Here at last was
the place she sought, a square, sturdy cabin of
gray logs chinked with white plaster, with a
solid field stone chimney and a sloping roof
drifted over with pine-needles. She slid from
the saddle and stood upon the rugged doorstep.
Here was her house, her very own!</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a larger dwelling than she had expected
and very solidly and substantially built.
She found that wooden bars had been nailed
across the doors and windows, and she had,
moreover, forgotten to obtain the keys from
Dan O’Leary, so that she could not go in.
She could, however, peep through the easement
windows and see the low-ceilinged rooms,
the rough stairs, and the wide fireplace. The
big trees nodded overhead, the roar of the
waterfall came from beyond the house, the
creek, rushing and tumbling, slid away down
the mountainside. Somebody had planted
pansies on both sides of the step, pansies that
crowded and jostled each other as they only
can in the cool air of the high mountains,
spreading sheets of gleaming color over the
barren soil. With a quivering sigh, Beatrice
sat down upon the step.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Mine!” she said aloud, just to see how it
would sound. “Mine!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It would take a long time to explore the
place thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I must be able to tell Nancy about every
bit of it,” she told herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet first she sat very quietly, for a little,
on the rough stone step. She had hurried up
the hill, eager to see the new place; she had
been hurrying for the last two days, getting
the house in the village settled; she had hurried
before the journey: when indeed had she not
been hurrying? It was very pleasant to sit
so still and let the silent minutes march by to
the tune of rustling pine branches and the murmuring
waterfall. As she sat looking down
into the valley, time seemed very big and calm
and empty, instead of bustling and full.</p>

<p class='c004'>She rose at last to go on with her explorations.
Behind the cabin was the tumbling cascade that
identified the place, a plunge of
foaming waters over a high ledge with a still
black pool below, shot with gleams of sunshine
and full of darting trout. Beyond the stream,
almost hidden from sight by the high slope of
the ravine, was the roof of another house, a
larger one than hers, with a whole group of
chimneys sending forth a curl of smoke to indicate
that here were neighbors. Looking up
the course of the brook she could see where the
dense shadows of the pine grove ended and the
waters ran in brighter sunshine on the higher
slope.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I should like to see what it is like up there,”
she thought, “but I must be quick; it is getting
late.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She went scrambling up the rocky slope,
feeling a little breathless, but forgetting entirely
that in such a high altitude haste is far
from wise. In a moment her lungs seemed
entirely empty and her heart began to pound
against her side, but she pressed on, determined to
reach a certain high rock before she
turned back. It was a rash desire, for presently
she was obliged to lie down upon the
rough grass to gasp and rest and gather herself
together for another effort. She got up
to struggle forward again, for she was not
used to abandoning a fixed purpose, but after
a few yards she was forced to lie down once
more, panting and completely exhausted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t believe I understand the Rocky
Mountains,” she reflected as she lay, limp and
flat, looking across the barren valley, the
sparsely wooded slopes, to the rising peaks opposite.
She had been accustomed to mountains
like the Adirondacks, round and covered
thick with forest almost to the summit,
friendly heights that invited one to climb them.
It was a far cry from them to the precipitate
slopes of Gray Cloud Mountain.</p>

<p class='c004'>When she had recovered a little she gave up
her project and slid humbly down the steep
way she had come. Buck, with his bridle over
the post at the cabin door, whinnied an anxious
welcome as she came back to him. He
had been searching for tufts of grass between
the stones, and had also nipped at the pansies,
but had found them not to his liking. His
impatience, as well as the creeping shadows
in the valley below, reminded her that evening
was near despite the clear sunshine higher up
the mountainside. Reluctantly she mounted
and, with many a glance backward at her
house, rode down the trail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through an opening in the trees Beatrice
caught a glimpse, as she descended, of the
house beyond the stream. She could even see
a man ride up to the door and a girl come running
out to greet him. Then a drop in the
trail hid both house and people abruptly
from her view.</p>

<p class='c004'>The warm sun seemed to be left completely
behind as she and Buck pressed onward with
all possible haste. Something new caught
her curious attention in a moment, however,
and made her stop again. To the right of the
pathway, in a little clearing among the pines,
she had spied the glow of a tiny fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is burning brush on my land?” she
questioned inwardly, with a throb of pride at
the thought of her proprietorship.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guiding her horse among the trees, she rode
a little nearer to investigate. The blaze was
kindled skilfully between two stones, evidently
by the hands of some one who knew the dangers
of careless camp-fires in a pine grove.
Bending over the crackling flame was a
woman, with a yellow handkerchief covering
her hair and a green shawl slanting about her
hips above a shabby skirt. A big basket
stood beside her, showing that she had been
gathering berries in the wood, while an appetizing
smell rising from the fire told of a supper
of bacon and fresh trout. The smoke was
in her eyes and she was, moreover, intent on
balancing the frying-pan between the stones,
so that she did not see Beatrice. For this the
girl was thankful, since, after a glance at the
other’s broad, brown face, she concluded that
one ill-mannered foreigner was all she wished
to encounter that day and that she would push
her investigations no further. She turned her
pony to make for the path again, but a rolling
stone, dislodged by Buck’s foot, attracted the
woman’s attention. Beatrice looked back to
see that the stranger had abandoned her cooking
and was standing erect, staring intently
after them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At least she cannot follow,” thought the
girl with some relief; then observed, with a
sinking of the heart, that the woman had
turned abruptly and was hurrying down the
hill through the underbrush. It was plain
that she intended to reach the road first and
intercept the horse and rider at the bridge.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER II <br /> THE DEPARTURE OF JOE LING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The yellow pony, stamping and sidling,
came to an unwilling stop before the
sturdy figure that blocked the way. Beatrice
began to see that the red firelight had made
the woman seem unduly terrifying and that
her face, while it was sunburnt almost to the
color of leather, was merely a square, stolid
one, with keen, blue eyes and heavy, fair hair
showing under the picturesque head handkerchief.
With one hard, big hand, the stranger
was feeling within her dress and, as Beatrice
came close, she held up a letter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I saw you in town yesterday, and you
looked kind. I want you to read my letter
to me; I cannot read English myself. My
name is Christina Jensen. The letter is from
my boy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She spoke with a strong accent that, while
it was somewhat like that of the man from
whom Beatrice had asked the way, was not
unpleasant, for her voice was rich and clear.
The girl thought as she looked into the upturned
face, that she had never seen such
eager, appealing eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You can’t read?” Beatrice exclaimed, forgetting
politeness in her surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'>“My own language, Finnish, yes, but not
yours. My boy, Olaf, made me learn to talk
English plain, but I was always so busy with
my two hands I could not learn to read or
write. Read, read, please, before it is too
dark to see the letter.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice spread out the paper on the pommel
of the saddle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” she said, glancing at the date, “it
is nearly a year old!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” returned the woman nodding heavily,
“ten months ago he wrote it from his ship
in Marseilles. I have nearly worn it out
carrying it around and having it read to me.
But it is only kind people I ask to read it now,
for some begin to say, ‘Like father, like son;
your Olaf will never come back.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was his father a sailor too?” the girl
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, but he sailed away from our home in
Finland when our boy was only a month old,
and I never heard from him again. It was
nearly a year later that we learned how his ship
had been wrecked on the voyage to Japan. I
brought my boy to this country then where I
could support him better, and what a credit and
a comfort to me he was. He was wild to go
in the navy when the war began, but he was
just too young; so it was not till last year that
he slipped away, as I had always feared he
would. He hardly even said good-by to me,
and this is my only letter from him. But I
talk too long; you will not be able to see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Once more Beatrice turned to the paper
and began:</p>

<p class='c004'>“My dear mother: I expect you think I am
never going to send you a letter—”</p>

<p class='c004'>She read through to the end, thinking that it
sounded affectionate but contained little news
beyond the fact that the writer was going to
China.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He gives an address to send an answer,”
she observed as she folded the letter and handed
it back. “What did you write to him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>To her surprise she saw big tears stand
suddenly in Christina’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, Thorvik would not let me, and I
couldn’t write myself,” she said. “And my
Olaf is such an American, he cannot read my
language. That is perhaps why he has not
written again and has not come home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then, seeing Beatrice’s puzzled look, she explained
more fully, although it was difficult to
make plain her foreign notion that women are
subject to the men in their houses.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thorvik is my brother, once a good Finn
like myself, but now—oh, so different. He
was to come to America some years ago, but
the war broke out over here and he went, instead
into the Russian army. Now that there
is peace he has come to us, but how that time
had changed him! He is full of wild talk of
revolution, and tyrants and destroying every
thing. He and Olaf never agreed. It was
what made my boy unhappy at home, and,
though I did what I could, Olaf went away
from us at last.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice leaned forward in her saddle with
sudden interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you live in a little cottage half-way up
the hill above Ely? That man I saw there
when I rode by—is that your brother?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Christina nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And if you could write to your son,” the
girl pursued, “what would you say?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would say, ‘Come home,’” cried Christina.
“Over and over I would say, ‘Come
home. If it is only for a week or a day between
voyages,’ I would say, ‘come still, no
matter what happened before you went
away.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice felt in the pocket of her riding
skirt. There were a note-book and pencil
there, she felt sure, for she had made a list of
supplies to be bought in the village before she
set out on her ride.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you want me to put down the address
and write to your son for you?” she offered.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, if you would!” cried Christina. “And
you would never tell Thorvik?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no danger of that,” Beatrice assured
her. “And I think somehow that your
boy will come back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She could not tell, herself, what made her
offer such a definite opinion.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was something she liked about the
words of the letter. “I went ashore at Marseilles,
and it is such a strange place that before
I had been there an hour I wanted to
stay a year. But loafing doesn’t suit me, so
I am off again for Hong-Kong, but I’ll not
forget you, Mother, not even on the other side
of the world.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She folded the worn page once again, gave it
to Christina, and rode on. To her own surprise,
she had that pleasant, satisfied feeling,
that comes with the making of a new friend.
After a few rods, she turned to look back and
saw the Finnish woman still looking after her.
Beatrice raised her hand in a quick gesture of
leave-taking. It was a slight move but it had
important consequences, since it seemed to cement
their regard for each other and to strengthen
Christina in a wavering resolution. She
came swiftly down the road, calling in her
clear, full voice:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stop, I must tell you something.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When she came to Buck’s side she began
with quick questioning that would have
sounded impertinent, had it not been so earnest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why did you come here, to Ely? How
long are you going to stay?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Briefly Beatrice explained about her aunt’s
health and the arrangements her father had
made.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe Aunt Anna wanted to come because
she had been here once before,” she concluded
rather vaguely. “I don’t seem to remember
if she told me when or why she came.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The place has changed since she was here,
even since your father was here.” Christina
declared. “There is a whole army of foreign
laborers, Slavs, Poles, what the men call Bohunks,
working on this irrigation project to
water the valley. There is a strike brewing.
Ah, do I not know? My brother Thorvik
talks of nothing else. It is he who urges them
on. When such a thing breaks out, Ely will
not be a good place for you and your aunt and
your sister.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But strikes mean just parades and people
carrying banners and talking on street-corners,”
Beatrice protested. She had seen industrial
unrest at home and had thought very little
of it. What she did fear was the long journey
which had been so difficult for her aunt
and which it seemed impossible to face soon
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Strikes are not the same in the West.
Men carry something besides banners in the
parades, and talking on street-corners ends in
fights. You had better take your aunt away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It does not seem possible,” Beatrice replied,
“but thank you for telling me.” Again she
said good-by and rode on, feeling only a little
uneasy, for, she reflected, “To live with a
man like that brother would make any one
think that things were going wrong.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There were lamps showing in some of the
windows of the Village, as she rode clattering
up the street, and streaks of light dropping
through the rickety shutters of a big, ramshackle
building in the center of the town. A
stream of men was moving up the steps of this
place, which seemed, as its door swung open,
to be a public meeting hall. Its benches were
crowded with rough-looking men, and someone
on a platform at the far end was addressing
the close-packed audience. She turned
Buck loose at her own door to find his way
home, as she had been instructed by Dan O’Leary.
Then, tired, stiff, and with much to
tell, she hurried into the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dinner that night, in the candle-lit dining-room
with the noiseless Chinaman serving them
delicious food, was very welcome to the hungry
Beatrice. Aunt Anna, looking very frail and
weary, but still able to sit up in her cushioned
chair, was at the head of the table, with one
tall chestnut-haired niece at her right and with
the other, the younger one, the pink and plump
Nancy who was always laughing and nearly
always asking questions, sitting at her left.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Joe Ling is a good cook,” observed Beatrice
with satisfaction, when their white-jacketed
chef had gone into the kitchen for the
dessert.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, but he wouldn’t let me come into the
kitchen to get Aunt Anna a glass of milk; and
when I told him about the broth she needed, I
couldn’t make out whether he heard or not,
for he paid no attention at all. I don’t think
I understand Chinamen. Their faces don’t
change, you can’t tell what they are thinking
about, and they look as though they knew
everything in the world.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy sighed as she spoke, for she had undertaken
the housekeeping, since she had more
domestic tastes than her sister. The new and
strange difficulties in this establishment in
Ely were, however, sometimes rather appalling.</p>

<p class='c004'>Aunt Anna said very little; she seemed to
have small appetite and to be too tired to
talk. After dinner Nancy went out to give
orders for breakfast, but she came in again
looking much discouraged. It seemed impossible
for her to get used to Joe Ling with
his mask-like face and silent Oriental manners.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next day Nancy was to try the new
horse; but she was not so good a rider as Beatrice,
and the astute Buck, guessing that fact
at once, took liberties with her that she did
not enjoy. She gave her sister a lively account
of her misadventures in the evening when
they were going to bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wanted to ride up to your cabin, but
Buck had other plans. I saw most of the
town and part of this end of the valley and
then the pony decided to take me home. Some
workmen, coming in from the place where they
are digging that big ditch, scowled and stared
at me and I didn’t like it. I sometimes wonder
a little why Aunt Anna wanted to come
here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who was with her when she was here long
ago?” Beatrice asked. “It seems to me that
I heard her talking of it to dad, and that she
said something about her—her brother.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Her brother—why, she hasn’t any but our
father,” objected Nancy. “If she had one he
would be our uncle, and we would know him.
It couldn’t be!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice was thinking so deeply that she
paused in brushing her hair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It does seem as though I remembered
about some such person, oh, a very long time
ago when we were little. It was some one
younger than father or Aunt Anna, with yellow
hair like hers. He used to come up to the
nursery to play with us, and then all of a sudden
he didn’t come any more and no one
talked about him, so I just forgot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is very puzzling,” returned Nancy.
“Perhaps we might write home about it, but
it would never do to worry Aunt Anna with
asking her. Meanwhile we will sleep on it,
for it is time to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sleeping on it, however, was the one thing
that they did not do. Nancy had put out the
light and was putting up the curtains when
she aroused her drowsy sister with a sudden
cry:</p>

<p class='c004'>“O, Beatrice, come here and look.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They stood together at the open window,
startled and terrified by what they saw. The
big hall in the next block was plainly visible,
with its shutters down and its door wide open,
as though the air within had become close
and stifling beyond endurance. The place
was still packed with men, but no orderly
company now. They were all standing,
some of them had climbed upon the benches,
and every one seemed to be shouting at once.
In the depths of the building, almost beyond
where they could see, somebody was waving
a red flag. Presently a group of men came
rushing down the steps, then more and more,
until the street was filled with an irregular,
shouting throng, waving hats, bandannas, and
banners and shrieking together, so many of
them in foreign tongues that it was impossible
to guess what they said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is the strike,” Nancy gasped. “Christina
did not tell you it would begin so soon or
be so—so terrible.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“That man walking at the head of them
all is her brother Thorvik,” said Beatrice. “I
wonder where they are going and what they
mean to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They lingered at the open window until
Nancy, sniffing suddenly, declared, “I smell
smoke.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Before Beatrice could answer, they heard in
the next room the voice of Aunt Anna, who
had been awakened by the uproar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is just a public meeting breaking up,”
Beatrice reassured her, although the sharp
smell of burning wood began to fill the room
as the blue smoke drifted in at the window.
The girls were about to go on with some explanation
when Nancy caught her sister’s arm
and, by a sign, made her look out.</p>

<p class='c004'>The side door, just below them, was opening
and closing silently, to allow the passing
of a stealthy figure. Joe Ling, with a pole
balanced over his shoulder and at either end
of it a heavy basket, was slipping away into the
dark with that short-stepping trot of a hurried
Chinaman. He had brought those same baskets,
containing all his worldly possessions, to
their house three days before. It was plain
that he not only considered his term of employment
with them at an end but that he was
about to shake the dust of Ely from his silent,
Chinese-slippered feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And oughtn’t we to go too?” Beatrice wondered
desperately.</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked at Aunt Anna, thin, weak, and exhausted,
lying on the bed. She heard outside the
crash of falling timbers and a great
shout as a shower of red sparks went sailing
past the window. A moment later there came
a violent knocking at the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>Was it Christina she wondered as she ran
down the stairs, or had some of those shouting
men——?</p>

<p class='c004'>She called softly before she dared draw the
bolt, and was relieved to hear the sound of
a woman’s voice. Christina stood on the threshold,
and with her Dan O’Leary’s helper at
the livery-stable, Sam.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Things have broken loose quicker than we
thought,” the woman began quickly, since there
was no need for explanations with that red flare
lighting up the whole village. “The men are
burning the empty warehouse, just to show
what devilment is in them. With this wind
the whole town may catch and they don’t care.
You and your aunt must get away as quickly
as you can. There is a train goes through in
less than half an hour, so you must hurry.
We couldn’t find Dan, but Sam here has
hitched up and will take you down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We will go at once,” Beatrice agreed, beginning
to gather up their possessions in the
living-room and to make ready for a hasty
packing. In the midst of her wild preparations,
however, there was a step on the stair
and Aunt Anna came slowly down, looking
very white and frightened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What is all this? What are you doing?”
she questioned and, from the combined explanations of
Christina, Sam, and her nieces, all
given at once, she seemed somehow to divine
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are only twenty minutes now,” Beatrice
urged. “We must be quick.” But Aunt
Anna did not move.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You may take the girls to the station,”
she said to Sam. “They can travel back alone,
but I am not going.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But you must,” cried Beatrice desperately.
“You will not be safe. You can never get
well in a tumult like this.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Aunt Anna gave her a strange look.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not come here to get well,” she said.
“I came for something very different. And I
am not going back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She swayed—caught at the railing, too faint
and ill to argue further. Nancy ran to help
her but she still struggled to make them understand.
She sent Beatrice a desperate, imploring
glance and strove to speak again, but
no words would come.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You must make her go,” insisted Christina.
“Sam can lift her on the train. She
will thank you in the end.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t understand at all why she wants to
stay,” she said, “but stay she shall. There is
only one other thing to do. We will go to the
cabin up on the mountain. Sam, can you get
the keys from Dan O’Leary’s house? The
place has been used lately, and it is safe from
this fire, at least. Nancy, pack Aunt Anna’s
things and I will gather up the rest. We
can’t start too soon.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Half an hour later the rickety old carriage
was groaning and lurching up the mountain
road. No one said a word as they climbed
steadily upward. Beatrice, looking back, saw
the red flames still leaping madly, still heard,
though faintly, the shouts of the men as they
ran here and there to bring fresh fuel to the
fire. The responsibility of choice had in the
end rested upon her; it would be her part to
make life in the mountain cabin possible.
Could she do it? Had she chosen well?
They came into the shadow of the forest, and,
in the stillness, following the uproar below,
they heard the weird yapping of a coyote
somewhere in the hills.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER III <br /> NEIGHBORS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Do you remember,” said Nancy, as she
and Beatrice viewed each other across a
wilderness of overflowing trunks, half-unpacked
boxes of bedding, baskets of china,
and packages of groceries, “do you remember
how that Englishman at your sorority dance
used to talk about an affair like this as ‘settling
in’? Settling wouldn’t be so hard, but
settling in! Will all this stuff ever go inside
this house?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” replied Beatrice abstractedly.
“It will have to go in somehow. Surely
we need everything that is here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She spoke absently, for the mention of the
dance had brought a sudden flood of memories
and of odd fancies. It had been the last one
she had attended before the doctor’s verdict
concerning Aunt Anna’s health, which had upset
all their plans and driven them West. It
must have been in another world, she thought,
that evening at the country club with the moonlight
coming in on the polished floor, with the
whirling maze of colored dresses, the swinging
music, and the soft sound of multitudes of
sliding feet. She stepped out upon the stone
doorstep, and looked down between the giant
red trunks of the pine-trees down upon the
white thread of road winding to the valley,
upon the huddle of box-like houses, with the
slow smoke rising from the blackened ruins in
the midst.</p>

<p class='c004'>A wave of panic seized her. Would she
know how to manage affairs in this strange
new world, this place of rugged, lonely peaks,
pine-forested mountainsides, of narrow valleys
filled with rioting men? Yet panic was
followed by sudden exhilaration, born, perhaps,
of the strange clearness of the thin air
and the brilliance of the morning sunshine.
She remembered the dance again, how she had
been manager of it and how the evening had
been full of congratulations on the success of
her arrangements. Yet in the midst of it she
had felt a vague discontent, a sudden wonder
whether this was all the pleasure that life had
to offer. Well, she thought now, with a long
breath of fresh, sparkling air, if she could hold
her own in that world, she could in this also,
and she returned to her work.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy, quite untroubled by any doubts or
fancies, was plodding steadily ahead at the task
in hand. It had been no hardship for her to
arise early, explore the possibilities of the kitchen,
concoct a breakfast out of such supplies
as they had brought with them, and carry it
in on a tray with a beaming and triumphant
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>Aunt Anna seemed to have suffered little
harm from the midnight flitting, and was sleeping
late after the excitements of the night before.
She had been made comfortable at once
in the one room that was in tolerable order;
for the girls had only to make up the couch
with the bedding they had brought, to build
a fire out of the pine cones that lay so thickly
under the trees, and the apartment was ready
for the invalid. Christina had taken charge
of the place for the former occupants, and had
left it very clean and in order. In the dry
Montana air, no house, even when closed for
months, grows damp, nor, in the clean pine
woods, even very dusty. Aunt Anna had remained
long awake, however; for, two hours
later when it was almost dawn, Beatrice had
stolen in and found her staring wide-eyed at
the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Can I do anything for you? Aren’t you
very tired?” the girl had asked, but her aunt
only smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am very comfortable,” she said. “I think
we are going to be very happy in this strange
little house. I am glad you had the courage
to bring me here, my child.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice stood beside the bed and straightened
the coverlid.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Won’t you tell me why you wanted so much
to stay?” she begged. “I wish I might know.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her aunt did not answer for a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I used to think,” she said at last, “that you
might never know, but perhaps, since last night,
I have changed my mind. Yes, whatever happens,
I believe I will tell you, but not just
now; for I am too weary to go through with
such a thing. Move my pillow a little, my dear;
I am going to sleep. The music of that waterfall
would make anybody drowsy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Before they had finished breakfast, Christina
had appeared, with Sam, heavy-laden, following
her, bringing more of their things from
the village.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I just packed everything that I thought
you would need and had Sam fetch it up,” said
Christina. “No, you can’t go down to the
town until things have quieted a little. There
was fighting last night, and Dan O’Leary has
been shot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just through the leg,” Sam reassured them,
seeing Nancy’s horrified face. “Dan has been
foreman of one of the ditching gangs, but he
owns the livery-stable and one of the stores, so
being a property holder makes him more careful
than the rest. He’s hot-headed enough,
though, and was leader of all the workmen
until this fellow out of Russia, Thorvik, came
to town. He goes Dan one better, and there
is no knowing what he won’t stir up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Is the strike going to last long?” Beatrice
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sam chuckled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It’s not a strike; that’s just where the
pinch is. While they were holding their meeting
last night, and arguing about how soon
they should quit, there comes word from the
company that the work is shut down until
further notice. Something has gone wrong
with the money end of the business, people
say, and there’s nothing to go on with. Anyway,
there’s no strike; the men higher up beat
them to it. Christina is right. The City of
Ely is no place for young ladies to be going
just now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He carried in the boxes and went down the
path for more.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s room in the shed for your horse,
Miss Beatrice,” he announced, when he had
made his last trip. “I can bring him up if
you like, only you would have to take care of
him yourself. We can haul up enough feed to
keep him, and there’s some grazing land higher
up the hill.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Accordingly it was settled that Buck, also,
was to be a part of their establishment, although
Beatrice felt a little appalled at the
prospect of taking care of a horse single-handed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bless you, he’s that wise he can almost take
care of himself,” Sam reassured her. “He’s
a little light on his feet when you go to saddle
him, but beyond that he hasn’t a fault. It
will be a good thing to have a horse on the
place.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Toward noon the two girls, with Christina’s
assistance, began to bring some order out of
the confusion. The cabin possessed four
rooms downstairs; the large living-room, into
which the front door opened; the bedroom off
it; the lean-to kitchen; and, wonder of wonders,
a tiny bath-room with a shining white porcelain
tub.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Those engineers who used the place just
settled down to make themselves comfortable,”
Christina explained. “They put in the water-pipes
themselves, and I’ll never forget the day
they brought up that tub, packed on a mule.
He bucked it off once and it slid down the
hill until it caught between two pine-trees.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The enterprising former tenants had also introduced
electricity from the power plant of
the nearest mine, so that the two most difficult
housekeeping problems of water and
light were thus already solved. The heavy table
and straight clumsy chairs must also have
been brought there by their predecessors, and
the bunks in the two little rooms under the
roof must have been their work. The men had
evidently slept on pine branches; but for the
girls Sam brought mattresses from the house
in the village and a comfortable bed for Aunt
Anna.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now,” said Nancy at last, “we have everything
we need except milk and eggs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe,” said Christina, who was scrubbing
the big table, “that over at John Herrick’s—he’s
your nearest neighbor—they could
spare you what milk and eggs you want. I
know they have a cow and that his girl, Hester,
makes a great deal of her chickens!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Neighbors! Beatrice had forgotten that
house, nearly hidden by the shoulder of the
mountain, but visible from the trail below.
There was a girl there, too, perhaps of their
own age. She was eager to go and investigate
at once and scarcely waited to hear how
to find the way.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a long walk down to the road beyond
the bars and then up the hill to the next house.
Beatrice realized, as she tramped along, that
distances are deceitful in high altitudes and
that the presence of Buck would be a great
convenience. The house, when she reached it,
was even larger than she had thought—a long,
low dwelling, with a row of sheds and stables
and an enclosed corral! She had just reached
the front steps when she saw the door fly open
and a brown-haired girl, with very bright,
dancing eyes, come running out in a flutter of
dark curls and flying blue and white skirts.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, oh!” cried Hester Herrick, grasping
Beatrice’s hand in her cordial brown one. “I
thought there was smoke in your chimney and
I couldn’t wait to know who was living in the
cabin. To have neighbors—you can’t think
what it means on this mountain! Come in,
come in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>To Beatrice, who had observed with some
distaste the flimsy houses of the village, the sagging
board walks and streets full of ruts and
boulders, this place was a delightful surprise,
with its air of spruce neatness and picturesque
charm. She liked the outside of the building,
the pointed gables and wide eaves; but, as Hester
conducted her within, she gave a little gasp
of wonder, for the house was really beautiful
inside. Beauty in a house, to her, had always
meant shining white woodwork, softly colored
rugs, and polished mahogany, but there
was nothing of all that here. The low room
with its windows opening toward the distant
mountains, was full of rich colors, the dull red
of the unceiled pine walls and bookcases, the
odd browns and yellows in the bearskin rugs,
the clear flame-color of the bowl of wild lilies
that stood on the broad window-sill. Hester
seated her guest in the corner of a huge comfortable
couch and sat down beside her with a
smile of broad satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was difficult to bring up such a prosaic
subject as milk and eggs in such pleasant surroundings;
but when that had been disposed of,
the two were soon chattering as though they
had known each other for years.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” commented Hester, nodding sagely,
as she heard the tale of their departure for
the cabin on the hill, “there is going to be real
trouble in Ely, so Roddy says, and he won’t
let me go down there just now. How glad I
am that you didn’t go away!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice’s eyes had been roving about the
room, observing the white birch log on the
hearth, the tawny-orange shade of the homespun
curtains, and even the pictures on the
wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” she exclaimed, her glance arrested
by a photograph hanging near the window,
“we have that same picture at home, in my
father’s study. It is of the school where he
used to go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hester looked up at the vine-covered archway
showing a tree-lined walk beyond.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know where Roddy got it,” she
said. “It has always been there, over his desk,
for as long as I can remember.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is Roddy, your brother?” Beatrice
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, he is my—my sort of father, but not
really. He is too young to be my father, I suppose.
He adopted me when I was very little.
His name is John Rodman Herrick, so, as
he’s only fifteen years older, I call him Roddy.
I can’t remember when I didn’t live in
this house with him, and with old Julia and
her husband Tim, to do the work for us.
There is Roddy now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The stride of heavy boots sounded along the
veranda, and a man came in, a handsome vigorous
person who, as Hester had said, looked too
young to be her father. Nor were they the
least alike in appearance, since he was very
fair, with thick, light hair and blue eyes that
contrasted oddly with his very sunburnt skin.
He wore ordinary riding clothes, but seemed
to carry an air of distinction in his clean-cut
profile and straight shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>He listened to Hester’s rather confused account
of Beatrice’s arrival and shook hands
with her gravely.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you going to be comfortable in the
cabin?” he asked. “Who is helping you get
settled?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is a Finnish woman who is doing
everything for us,” Beatrice told him. “I
have never seen any one who worked so hard.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She told how she had first met Christina in
the wood, and what gratitude and assistance
the woman had given them later.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Poor Christina, she can never put that boy
out of her mind,” John Herrick said. “He
was a good fellow, Olaf Jensen, and I have
missed him since he left Ely. He was always
in some mischief or other and his last escapade
before he went to sea came near to being serious.
There are still men in the village telling
what they will do to him when he comes back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What was it he did?” Beatrice asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>John Herrick began to laugh.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Olaf was working with one of our ditching
gangs, and a good workman he was. Suddenly,
one day while they were digging near
the river, Olaf pointed to a high rock opposite,
called Mason’s Bluff, a well-known and dangerous
place. There seemed to be a man hanging
by a rope halfway down the face of it, unable,
apparently, to get either up or down.
The laborers didn’t take much interest—said
any one was a fool who would try such a climb;
and not one of them would budge an inch to
help him. Then Olaf remarked casually, ‘It
must be that scientist fellow who was in our
camp yesterday. Do you remember that rich
tenderfoot who went around spending money
and tapping rocks?’ Every man dropped his
tools, for if there is a chance for a reward these
Bohunks are on the job at once. You should
have seen them scurrying down to the river,
getting across any way they could, and running
like rabbits through the brush, each one
determined to be first on the spot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And did they save him?” Beatrice inquired
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The first ones were within a hundred yards
when the man fell.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She gasped, but he went on with a dry
chuckle.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They went nearer to pick him up and found
he was a dummy man, stuffed with straw.
Then they remembered that Olaf had been
laughing at them for being willing to do anything
for money and nothing without it, and
they came back to camp vowing to have his
blood. Even I was surprised at what an ugly
temper they showed, but Olaf was wise enough
to know how they would feel, and when they
came back he was gone. Probably he meant
to go anyway and wanted to have one final
fling.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice, glancing at the clock, was horrified
to see how long she had stayed and rose
at once to go. Both her new friends came to
the door with her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“By the way,” said John Herrick as Beatrice
stood on the step below, “my Hester is
too informal a person for introductions, and
she has not even told me your name. Indeed,
I doubt if she knows it herself. Won’t you
tell us who you are and who is at the cabin
with you?”</p>

<p class='c004'>What a cordial, friendly smile, he had, Beatrice
thought, and how it lighted his brown
face!</p>

<p class='c004'>“My Aunt Anna and my sister Nancy are
at the cottage with me,” she said. “The place
is mine; my father gave it to me. My name
is Beatrice Deems.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Never had she seen a countenance change so
abruptly as did John Herrick’s as he turned
suddenly and went into the house, leaving
Hester to say her good-bys alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was at the end of a very laborious but
satisfactory day that Nancy came up to her sister’s
room to find Beatrice writing at the
rough pine table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Everything is in order, and Christina and
Sam have just gone,” said Nancy. “There
wasn’t anything more you wanted them to do,
was there?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I wanted them to mail my letters,” exclaimed
Beatrice, seizing her envelopes and
jumping up. “It took me so long to write
everything to dad that I only just finished
this one that I promised Christina for her boy,
Olaf. Perhaps I can catch Sam at the gate.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She sped down the path through the pines
and was able to overtake Christina and Sam
where they had paused to put up the bars.
Beatrice was just explaining to the Finnish
woman what she had written, when a heavy
slouching figure came up the road through the
shadows and Thorvik, in his broken English,
addressed his sister roughly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You spend the whole day here—spend the
night too? I have not yet my supper!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was evident that he wished Beatrice, also,
to know of his displeasure, or he would have
used his own tongue. He grasped Christina
angrily by the arm and shot the girl a scowling
glance of such fierce enmity that involuntarily
she shrank back behind the gate. It was
difficult, under that frowning scrutiny, to hand
the two letters to Sam,—the more so since
Christina eyed one of the envelopes with such
nervous apprehension. Even a duller eye
than Thorvik’s might have noted that the letter was
of special importance to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sullen animosity deepened on the man’s
face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You make nothing more with my sister;
see?” he said, as he led Christina away.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sam nodded a subdued good night, clucked
low-spiritedly to his horses, and drove slowly
after the two. Even his unquenched cheerfulness
seemed affected by instinctive dread of
Thorvik’s sour ill-temper. Nor was it with
a very cheerful heart that Beatrice walked back
alone up the path. It rendered her task of
living by no means easier to realize that she
had made an enemy of such a man as Thorvik.
Yet the light from her cabin, shining small
and yellow beneath the giant pines, seemed
somehow to rekindle her failing courage.
Those two dearly loved people were there
within, Nancy and Aunt Anna. Surely the
way would be shown to her to care for them
and keep them safe.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER IV <br /> SHERLOCK HOLMES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was a week later and Beatrice, with a
landscape of blue mountains and green
forest showing beyond her through the open
door, was standing on the threshold in her riding
clothes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have finished my share of the housework
and I am off for a ride,” she said to Nancy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her sister smiled broadly over her dusting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would never have thought,” she declared,
“that you could curry a horse and split the
kindling before breakfast and that I could
scrub floors and wash dishes every day and
that we both of us would like it. There
must be something strange in this mountain
air.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had begun to feel as settled as though
they had been at their housekeeping in the
cabin for months. The cottage itself was a different
place, an entrancingly pleasant and comfortable
one. Hester Herrick, with whom
they were now great friends, was always bringing
them things—some big black andirons
for the great fireplace, a collection of soft
pine pillows, and the thick bearskin rug that
lay before the hearth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Roddy said you were to have it. He shot
the bear himself last winter,” she said when the
girls protested that this last gift was too great
a one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sam also had brought a bashfully presented
offering, the pelt of a mountain lion which now
served as Aunt Anna’s bedside rug. Nancy
had put up white blue-bordered curtains at
the little square windows and had set on the
wide sills pots of red berries, boxes of ferns,
and bowls of bright-faced pansies.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the fresh wind fluttering the curtains
and the sunshine lying in patches on the white
scrubbed floor, the little cabin was as gay and
homelike a place as heart could desire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Christina, in spite of Thorvik’s interdiction,
still came every day. This morning she arrived
earlier than usual, with their marketing
in a big basket and the mail; for it was not,
even yet, a good thing for the girls to go often
to the village. She took some letters in to
their Aunt Anna and remained for some time,
since Aunt Anna appeared to be asking her
questions.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” the girls heard Christina say, through
the door, “there is no one of your name hereabouts.
But Olaf and I have only lived in
this valley ten years, so it might have been
before.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice looked up, startled. What had her
aunt been asking and why should there be any
one of their name living in this far-off place?
She remembered her former wonder concerning
that brother of whom they never heard
anything at home. But Christina came out
and closed the door, the bright morning was
calling, and Beatrice forgot her curiosity in
looking forward to her ride.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t you want to go, Nancy?” she said as
she went through the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” returned Nancy briskly, “I don’t care
for riding as you do, and this morning I
would not go for anything. Christina is going
to teach me how to make bread.” The
exploration of strange forests and dizzy mountainsides
was nothing to Nancy, compared with
the excitement of cooking something new.</p>

<p class='c004'>To saddle Buck was now a less difficult affair
than at first, for his mistress had learned
to fling the object of his hatred upon him and
then stand back, giving adroit jerks at the
cinch between his kicks and plunges. When
he had got his fill of bucking he would turn
his white face to her as if to say, “That is all
for to-day; now let’s be off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her expedition was doomed to delay, however,
for, as she was leading her pony around
the corner of the house, she came upon a visitor,
a total stranger, standing on the doorstep.
He was apparently annoyed at finding no doorbell
and having his knock go unheard. He
shuffled his feet, coughed, and rapped smartly
on the door again and again, as though he
were a person of such importance that he
could not afford to be kept waiting. Beatrice
realized suddenly how used she had become to
Ely’s conventional costume of flannel shirt and
high boots, since this dapper newcomer, with
his pointed shoes and tight, high-waisted coat
looked not only uncomfortable, but absurd.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good morning, Miss Deems. Beautiful
day, is it not?” began the stranger easily.
“Mills is my name, Dabney Mills of the
Brownsville, Montana ‘Evening Star.’ My paper
has sent me here, or rather I volunteered
to come, to investigate this unfortunate affair
going on in Broken Bow Valley.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, you mean the strike?” Beatrice asked,
rather bewildered and not knowing at all why
the overdressed Mr. Mills should have sought
out their remote cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>He made a movement as though to go in,
but, since Beatrice seemed not at all inclined
to open the door, he sat down on the step with
smooth assurance, laid his hat on the stone, and
took out a note-book.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The affair is more like a lockout than a
strike, but not exactly that, either,” he continued
with that irresistible fluency of speech
adopted by people who talk a great deal to unwilling
listeners. “As I understand it, the
situation is this. The Broken Bow Irrigation
Co. undertakes to construct the necessary
dams, ditches, and sluice-gates to water this
dry valley, a big project in which a certain
John Herrick, resident of these parts, has large
interests.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not know about John Herrick’s share
in it,” Beatrice said. She was beginning already
to catch the Western habit of dropping
the title “mister” except in direct address.
Since she was unwilling that the stranger
should come in, for fear he would disturb and
annoy Aunt Anna, and since he made no move
to go away, she finally sat down herself upon
the step.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The money for this affair,” Mills went on,
“was raised in part, as is usual, by the owners
of the land which is to be irrigated, but the
greater amount was to be subscribed by capitalists
outside the valley, John Herrick pledging
himself to see that the necessary sum was
forthcoming. So far, so good.” He tapped
the note-book with a stubby forefinger and
went on with significant emphasis. “Since
there is no bank in Ely, there are often large
sums in currency brought to pay the men and
deposited in the Irrigation Company’s safe.
It is known that, just before this outbreak, the
finances of the company were in good condition
and that there was no talk of funds giving
out before the work was completed. Yet
when the men held a meeting to debate whether
they should go on or should strike for increased
wages—they had already had one increase but
Thorvik insisted it was not enough,—they
were served with a notice that the capital was
exhausted and that construction was shut
down. That is what all the trouble is about.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He looked at Beatrice very wisely, but she
said nothing. She was aware of Nancy standing
in the door and looking at Dabney Mills’
back in round-eyed astonishment. She called
her sister out finally, and introduced the newcomer
stiffly, and motioned Nancy to sit beside
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, sir, the money was gone!” The polished
manner of Mills’ narrative dropped suddenly
into the colloquial, as though the effort
had been too much for him. “The men mobbed
the office building demanding to know what
had happened, and the officers of the unions
were allowed to examine the books and even
to look into the safe, but it was plain to them
all that the company couldn’t turn up a red
cent. Been stolen, so people begin to say, but
no one knows who did it. Now the men are
lounging around town, idle, quarreling, looking
for trouble. Not a wheel can turn until
the money is found.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy looked at him with inquisitive interest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And did you come to Ely to find it?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well—why, if you put it that way, I guess I
did,” he answered, reddening a little, but seeming
flattered, on the whole, by the bluntness of
her question. “I told the editor of my paper
that it would make a big story if any one could
find out just who made way with that money.
He didn’t think a cub reporter could do much,
but I offered to come up here on my own responsibility
and get to the bottom of the whole
affair. It will be a smashing big hit for me
if I make good.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He opened his note-book and fluttered over
the leaves.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of course the sheriff is working on the job,
but these country officials are no sleuths. It
will take a smarter man than he is to get anywhere.
I’m on my way up to interview John
Herrick; he’s the big man of the company and
he ought to be able to give me something. But
in case he won’t talk I thought I would stop
and learn what I could from his neighbors, I
understand you know Miss Herrick well.
Now anything you can tell me will be useful.
What do you know of John Herrick or his
habits or his business?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He waited with pencil poised.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We don’t know anything, and we wouldn’t
tell you if we did,” cried Nancy indignantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It isn’t hard usually to find out about people
from their neighbors,” Dabney Mills declared,
quite unabashed. “You are staying
with your aunt, I understand. Perhaps if I
went in and spoke to her——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You will do nothing of the sort.” Beatrice
had found the voice of which astonishment and
anger had robbed her. “My aunt is not to be
disturbed, and there is not the least use in asking
us any more questions.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, well, of course, if you are going to take
it like that——!” Dabney Mills rose and
pocketed his note-book. He seemed quite
unoffended and not convinced even yet that
his quest was fruitless. “I’ll drop in again in
a day or two.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice walked with great dignity into the
house, followed by Nancy, who could not help
turning to look after the reporter as he trudged
away through the pines, the cock of his hat
and the swagger of his shoulders showing that
he did not acknowledge defeat.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I do hope Aunt Anna wasn’t disturbed,”
said Beatrice as she tiptoed into the inner room
to discover her aunt propped up in the invalid
chair and rocked by a gale of laughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You did very well, my dears,” Aunt Anna
said. “Even his back is bristling with indignation
as he marches away. I could not help
overhearing with the door open, and you were
both well equal to the situation. What a
strange, impertinent man, or boy rather, for he
is scarcely grown up. I wonder that any reputable
newspaper employs him!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“He said he was doing this on his own responsibility
and was going to sell the news to
a paper later,” explained Beatrice. “He
thinks he is going to make some startling
discovery.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe,” asserted Nancy wagging her
head sagely, “that when he was young and his
character was forming, his mother let him read
too many detective stories and they didn’t
agree with him. He thinks he is Sherlock
Holmes and Craig Kennedy and all the others
rolled into one. That is what is the matter
with him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You take a charitable view, Nancy,” returned
her aunt, “and I rather think your diagnosis
is right. But insistent, foolish people
of his kind can often do a great deal of harm
without intending it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice returned finally to the impatient
Buck and rode down the path toward the gate.
It was her intention to explore some of the
upper trails of the mountainside to-day, for
she had no desire to ride in the direction of the
village. Once only had she been forced to go
to town and she had felt very uneasy under the
sullen unfriendly stares of the idle foreigners
lounging about the doorways or sitting in rows
at the edge of the board sidewalks.</p>

<p class='c004'>She was to be delayed once more, however,
by another visitor, one even more unwelcome
than the first. She had dismounted to give a
final jerk to the cinch of the girth and was
about to swing into the saddle again to ride
through the gate when she saw Thorvik come
striding across the lowered bars. His face
was red with the heat of his steep climb and
the veins stood out on his forehead below his
bristling tow-colored hair. Such a face she
had never seen before, distorted with anger and
flushed with evil hate. He pulled a letter from
his pocket as he came near and held it up.
Thinking that it was for her she stretched out
her hand to take it, but he snatched it back
beyond her reach.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are to look, not to have it,” he said in
a voice thick with rage.</p>

<p class='c004'>She saw it was addressed in a plain, schoolboy
hand to “Mrs. Christina Jensen, Ely,
Montana.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why,” she cried, “it must be from——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“From that Olaf,” snarled Thorvik, “and
why should he be writing, if not because he has
had an answer to his letter of long ago. I
told her there should be no answer. Who
wrote for her?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did,” returned Beatrice steadily, although
her hot temper was beginning to rise within
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She made a move to remount her horse, but
the man stepped forward and seized the bridle.
Buck, nervous and startled, wheeled and
reared, but could not jerk free from the iron
grip on his bit. Thorvik moved up the path
and put himself between Beatrice and the
house. Terror as well as anger was beginning
to take possession of her, but she faced him
without flinching.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You wrote it—after I forbid?” His voice
shook with fury. “Then this is what I do with
the answer.” He slipped the rein over his
arm and with his great hard hands tore the
letter into shreds that went whirling and scattering
in the wind all across the side of the hill.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Had Christina read it?” cried Beatrice in
dismay.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, Christina cannot read, nor I. She is
crying at home. I told her I would bring the
letter to you and tear it up before your face,
to show you how much use is it to meddle with
the business of other people.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And she will never know what he said?”
Beatrice exclaimed. “You took it from her
before she could hear? You coward—you——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Steady, my dear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A man’s quiet voice sounded at her elbow,
and she turned suddenly to see John Herrick.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anger won’t get you anywhere with people
of this fellow’s kind,” he said gently. “If
you wish to order a man off your grounds, you
must do it quietly.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So, standing firm on the path, fortified by
the knowledge that John Herrick was beside
her, Beatrice had the strange delight of directing
an impertinent intruder to drop her horse’s
rein and leave her premises, and of seeing him
obey. For Thorvik went. He blustered, stammered,
then finally relinquished Buck’s bridle
and marched away to the gate. He stopped
before he passed through to hurl a defiance
over his shoulder, but he hastened on immediately
after.</p>

<p class='c004'>“His threats grow louder the further
away he goes,” commented John Herrick.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I—I am glad you came,” observed Beatrice
a little shakily. The incident had been an unpleasant
one, nor could she guess what the result
would have been had not help appeared
from such an unexpected quarter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am glad also,” he returned gravely. “A
strange creature who called himself a reporter
stopped me at my door as I was starting for
the village. He asked me a great many impudent
questions, but he happened to mention
that he had seen Thorvik going in through your
gate. At that, I rode off at once, leaving him
with his mouth and his note-book both still open.
Here comes our journalistic friend now. He
seems to find this morning sun a trifle uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Very hot and wilted did Dabney Mills look
as he came trudging down the path, his handkerchief
stuck into his over-tall but exceedingly
limp white collar. Yet his inquiring spirit still
seemed undismayed. He stopped where John
Herrick’s nervous black pony was tied, peered
over the fence, and poised his pencil once more
above a page.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Won’t you just tell me——” he began.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have told you already,” said John Herrick,
“that I have nothing to say. When the
men get rid of their leader and come to me
willing to work again, we will inquire into this
matter of the company’s finances. But while
they are not in our employ, the company’s
money is none of their business. Until Thorvik
leaves Ely and the laborers stop talking of
strikes, things shall stand exactly as they are.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His tone was so final that even Dabney Mills
realized that this was the end of the interview
and walked on unwillingly in the direction
Thorvik had gone. John Herrick caught
Buck, gave the rein to Beatrice, and went to
untie his own horse, but hesitated a moment
before mounting. His manner assumed suddenly
a stiff shyness quite unlike his cordiality
of a moment before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is one thing more,” he began. “I
have been away for some days, but I now understand
from Hester that your aunt, who is
with you, has been ill. Is that true?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” assented Beatrice. She was puzzled
by his change of manner, but she still felt
that his kindness invited confidence, and she
told him fully of the state of Aunt Anna’s
health and how concerned they were about her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wanted to suggest,” John Herrick went
on slowly, “that there is a doctor who lives on
the other side of Gray Cloud Mountain, a man
who does not practise now, but who has been
a famous specialist for just such illness. He
could help your aunt, I know. He would
come to see her if I asked him, for he has always
been a good friend to me. Would you
care to consult him?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, indeed I would. How kind of you,
how wonderfully good to have thought of it!”
exclaimed Beatrice. She had seen the regular
doctor of Broken Bow Valley and had not felt
that he could help them very greatly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, it is nothing,” John Herrick returned,
apparently somewhat disturbed by the eagerness
of her gratitude. “It is just friendly interest
in a neighbor.” He went on speaking
in a tone of rather careful indifference. “Dr.
Minturn and his wife are very fond of my
Hester, and she often rides over to visit them.
It takes a whole day to go there and another
to come back, but I believe she would like to
take the ride with you. She was saying something
yesterday about going soon to see them.
I would fetch the doctor myself, but I cannot
leave Ely to-day. As he does not often ride
to town for his mail and there is no telephone
line, he is rather difficult to reach. If you
wish to wait for a day or two, I will gladly go
to fetch him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no,” replied Beatrice. “I will go to-day
if Hester is willing. I feel as though I
could not wait. And how can I ever thank
you for—for everything?”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a curious wistfulness in the look
that John Herrick bent upon her, and a great
kindness also.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have taken up rather a large task,”
he said slowly; “taken it for the most part
upon your own shoulders. I want you to know
that, as far as it is in my power, I am going
to help you make a success of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His shyness had dropped as suddenly as it
had come upon him and there was nothing but
the warmest friendliness in his smile as he
swung into the saddle.</p>

<p class='c004'>By a touch upon the bridle, Beatrice turned
Buck’s head toward the house, then paused and
looked back at John Herrick. She saw that
he had not moved but was sitting his horse
staring after her. Upon sudden impulse she
wheeled her pony and rode up to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are taking a great deal of trouble for—for
strangers,” she said, looking him very
steadily in the eyes. “I don’t think I can
ever make you understand how grateful I
am.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is you who do not understand,” he returned
gravely, “I——”</p>

<div id='i096'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus-096.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“It is you who do not understand,” he returned gravely</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Whether his impatient black horse would no
longer wait or whether he broke off what he
was saying by a jerk of the rein, Beatrice
could not tell. His pony plunged, turned,
and went galloping away down the road,
leaving her and Buck to set their faces once
more toward the cabin.</p>

<p class='c004'>It did not take her many minutes to explain
matters to Nancy and Aunt Anna, to gather
up what she would need for the journey, and
to bid them an excited good-by.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Of <i>course</i> it is all right for me to go,” she
assured her aunt in reply to some faint protest.
“Hester goes often and she will be there
to show me the way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She was away down the path as fast as
Buck’s nimble feet would take her. When
she rode up to the door of the next house,
Hester was not immediately visible, but
she appeared presently from the kitchen.
With a troubled face she listened to the
plan of their going across the mountain together.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish I could go,” she said, “but old Julia
has one of her attacks of rheumatism and I
know I should not leave her. Won’t you
wait a few days until I can go or Roddy can
ride over for us?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice, impatient and disappointed, sat
silent in her saddle, thinking deeply. She
looked down into the long, sun-flooded valley,
then up at the sharp slopes above and the
white, winding trail, calling her to the adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why shouldn’t I go alone?” she asked
boldly. “Where you can go, surely Buck and
I can go also.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Hester looked doubtful.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The way is clear enough,” she said, “and
not very hard going, but you have never
ridden over it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice would listen to no objections. By
the weight of her two years’ seniority and her
natural determination, she speedily overcame
all of Hester’s misgivings. She made her
friend give her full directions, which she felt
would be easy to follow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am to keep to the line of the stream as far
as its head waters and then go up through a
cleft between two rocks at the very top of the
pass,” she repeated. “You say the trail is
fairly plain all the way? Certainly I can
follow it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“One of the men said something about some
rocks that had fallen at the very head of the
stream, and you may have to go around
them,” Hester said. “Otherwise it is all plain.
Be careful on the slopes of loose stone and
don’t leave the trail.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I will be careful,” returned Beatrice.
“O Hester, what a ride it is going to be!”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was not a mile of the way that disappointed
her. Up and up they went, through
forest, across clearings, fording the noisy shallows
of the stream that was their guide, scrambling
across the faces of rocky slopes where
Buck picked his way as warily as a cat. She
ate her lunch beside the stream, drank of the
ice-cold water and rode on.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We must be nearly to the pass,” she
thought at last, and stopped to look back.
Broken Bow Valley had shrunk to a mere
creek-bed, one among many watercourses
winding beneath. The heavy, dark forest
seemed to cling, like a blanket, to the lower
slopes of the mountains, as though it had
slipped away from the smooth rocky shoulders
of the heights above. Gray Cloud Pass was
not a very high one, but to her inexperienced
eyes, the depths below her were almost enough
to make her dizzy. A cold wind blew down
from the ice-fields so that she huddled herself
into the grateful warmth of her sheepskin
coat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Higher still they mounted until they came,
as Hester had foretold, to an impassable mass
of rock that had fallen across the trail. The
détour was difficult, up a barren slope covered
with stunted bushes, and out on a naked spur
whence she could look away at peak beyond
peak, some bleak and dark, some shining with
never-melting snow. Such tiny specks of creatures
as she and Buck were, crawling like flies
over the rocky hillside!</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t leave the trail.” So Hester had
warned, but there could be no harm in climbing
a little higher, since she could see so
plainly where her pathway began again and
wound crookedly to the narrow passage between
two huge boulders where she and Buck
must go through. Above her, caught in a
cleft in the great shoulder of the mountain,
was a still, dark lake, its waters held in this
cup of the rocks and fed by the melting snows
of the ice-fields far above. She felt that she
must see it closer and urged her pony forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was as still as a polished mirror, deep-blue
and fringed by a dark circle of pines.
While she stood, staring fascinated at the
gleaming surface, a deer came down to drink,
swam leisurely across the far end of the lake,
and disappeared into the forest. The motion
seemed to break her dream, for she turned
quickly in the saddle and looked down. She
had climbed above the very summit of the pass,
for she could see where the trail dipped downhill
again, disappearing in a mass of trees.
It even seemed that she could discern a cottage
below and a wide, open slope of hillside.
She could also see, however, that the sun was
perilously near the line of the mountain tops
and that the day was coming to an end.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We must hurry,” she thought quickly. “I
believe this is the best way down.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Buck moved forward, hesitated, felt for his
footing, and hesitated again. An ominous
sound came to her ears, the rattling of sliding
stones. The horse slipped, went forward
several yards apparently with no will of his
own, then stopped and turned his white face
to look around at her. She dismounted to
lead him, but felt the loose shale give way under
her feet. Frantically she caught at the
pommel of Buck’s saddle, but in a moment
they were both slipping together while the
rattle of the stones increased into a roar.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Buck,” she cried aloud, “what have I
done!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The whole mountain seemed to be moving
under her feet; she knew dimly that the saddle
horn was snatched from her grasp, just before
she plunged forward into darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER V <br /> CHRISTMAS-TREE HILL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>When Beatrice opened her eyes, a
soft, insistent nose was passing over
her face and hands and breathing warmly against
her cheek. She sat up, holding her
whirling head, to discover that Buck was standing
over her, apparently puzzled and distressed
at the mishap to his mistress. It
seemed strange, after her last glimpse of that
barren mountain-side of sliding shale, to find
herself lying half buried in grass and flowers
with the warm sunshine laying a level ray
across her face. She got to her knees and
then to her feet, and found that she was possessed
of a dizzy head and an aching shoulder,
that she was bruised and lame, but otherwise
uninjured. Looking up, she could see where
the slope of loose stone, down which she and
the horse had slid, ended in a straight wall, a
drop of eight or ten feet, over which she had
plunged into the soft grass below. Buck,
wiser than she, had evidently managed to slide
less precipitately, and in the end had saved
himself by jumping. His legs were cut by
the sharp stones and he was still nervous and
quivering, but he was not seriously harmed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although she made an effort to climb into
the saddle, Beatrice found that her knees were
shaking and her head was so dizzy that she
was forced to give up the attempt. With her
hand upon the horse’s neck, she walked along
the crooked path trodden in the tall grass of
this high mountain meadow. Bright flowers
whose names she did not know brushed her
skirts. The whole hillside, sloping to the
west, was bathed in the last brightness of the
waning sunlight. They passed through a tangle
of poplar woods whose dense underbrush
showed that it was second growth, springing
up after the pine forest had been cut. Then
out into the open they came again, to look
down into a broad, irrigated valley whose
checker-board of fields followed the winding
silver ribbon of the river.</p>

<p class='c004'>And this hillside at her feet—was it a forest
or a garden into which she had stumbled?
Hundreds of little spruce-trees, as tall as her
shoulder and all of the same height, marched
in straight rows across the slope of the mountain,
clothing the steep ground in a smooth
mantle of lusty green. A stream wound
downward through the plantation, and on its
bank, on a level bench below her, were a clump
of willows and a white cottage with a red roof
and a wide-open door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That must be Dr. Minturn’s house,” Beatrice
reflected and a moment later caught sight
of Dr. Minturn himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was sitting on a knoll at the edge of the
woods, gazing down over his domain and humming
a song in a deep, buzzing voice like a
bumble-bee. He was a very tall man, with
tremendous shoulders and a heavy thatch of
gray hair. He did not notice Beatrice and
Buck, even when they came close, but sat very
still, his big hands lying idle on his knees.
He had the air, however, of being intently
busy about some project of his own. Beatrice
watched him, fascinated, wondering what it
could be that absorbed him so.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What—what are you doing?” she asked at
last.</p>

<p class='c004'>He turned around to her, smiling slowly,
seeming neither startled nor surprised.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m getting rich,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>She looked so bewildered by his reply that
he jumped up at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That is one of my stupid jokes and I’ve
startled you with it,” he exclaimed in a tone
of self-reproach. “And you have come over
that trail all alone—why, you’ve had an accident.
Come down to the house at once and
let Miriam and me see what we can do for
you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He helped her into the saddle, took Buck’s
bridle, and conducted them down through the
rows of spicy-smelling little trees to the door
of the cottage. On the way Beatrice managed
to explain why she had come and at whose
suggestion. The doctor nodded his head in
immediate agreement.</p>

<p class='c004'>“To be sure, I will go,” he said. “I would
do anything for John Herrick or a friend of
his, so that’s all settled. Here’s Miriam
coming to the gate to meet you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The cottage was square and neat and white
and had a garden before it, surrounded by a
white paling fence—the first garden Beatrice
had seen since she came to Broken Bow Valley.
It gave her a pang of homesickness to look at
the tangled hedge of pink wild roses, the
clumps of yellow lilies and forget-me-nots,
and the bright borders of pansies. Miriam, at
the gate, was a plump, quiet-voiced person
with smooth gray hair and a placid smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miriam would have a garden,” Dr. Minturn
said when the greetings were over and
Beatrice had admired the flowers. “Almost
everything in it is just what runs wild over
the mountains, but she prefers them behind a
fence. I think she dreams at night of how
to make those big, wild forget-me-nots look
like the little cultivated ones.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“The doctor likes to make fun of my garden,”
Mrs. Minturn said in her pleasant soft
voice. “But it is not very different from what
he has done with the whole mountain-side.
It was as bare as your hand when we came
here, and he has planted every one of the little
pines himself and has nursed each tree as
though it were a baby. We call it Christmas-tree
Hill. But come in, my dear; you must
rest and wash that cut on your cheek.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She led Beatrice to the house and, in taking
it quite for granted that her guest was to
spend the night, conducted her to what the
girl thought was the smallest and cleanest bedroom
she had ever seen. Here Mrs. Minturn
insisted that she must lie down and be tucked
up under the patchwork quilt and “go to sleep
for an hour if she could.” Beatrice did not
sleep, but lay very peacefully, staring at the
rough plastered walls of the tiny room or,
through the window, at the myriad little trees
stepping in their straight, decorous rows across
the side of the hill. Long before the hour
was over she was beginning to feel quite rested
and herself again, and when her hostess came
to announce that supper was ready she was
sitting at the window, gazing out at the sunset
light on the white peaks of the range opposite.</p>

<p class='c004'>After they had eaten, Dr. Minturn insisted
that she make a tour of the place and, “Go
on, my dear, I don’t need any help with the
dishes,” Mrs. Minturn said when her guest
wished to stay and assist her. “It isn’t often
that the doctor has a chance to show things
off to a new person, so don’t deny him the
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice accordingly saw everything: the
horses, the contented cows, even the cheerful
pig grunting happily to himself in his spotless
sty. The chickens occupied a substantial
residence on account of the owls, coyotes, martens,
and other wild animals that lent difficulty
and excitement to poultry raising in the
Rocky Mountains. Then the doctor led Beatrice
beyond the garden and the clump of willows
to where she could see the whole sweep
of the mountain and the shadows flooding the
valley as darkness crept up the hill.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was a plan of my own, this replanting
where the pine forest has been cut,” he explained,
as he sat down by Beatrice on the
grassy slope, evidently delighted to have some
one to listen to his enthusiasm. “The Government
does a good deal of this reforesting
where tracts have been cut down or burned,
but they can’t give the trees the care that I
do. Nobody could except a man who loves
them. As they grow big I keep taking out
some for Christmas-trees or for small timber,
but the bulk of them shall never be cut until
they have grown to be giants, a hundred feet
high. I love to sit here and watch them, each
year a little bigger, each year more valuable.
It will be a wonderful piece of timber land
fifty, sixty, seventy years from now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—but——” began Beatrice and
stopped. She had almost blurted out that a
man who was gray-haired at the planting of
these trees could not hope to see them grow to
that mighty forest of which he dreamed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I know I will be gone long before
then,” he replied serenely, “but what does it
matter? We live here in the mountains to
keep Miriam well; she doesn’t get on in the
valleys and towns. She has her garden and
I have my trees and we are happy enough,
thinking about the future, even if it is a future
long beyond our time. Mines that we never
heard of will be timbered from these trees, to
bring out gold and silver for our children’s
children; there will be ships with these pines
for masts that will sail to ports I never saw.
There will be houses built—I can almost see
the people that will be born and live and die
under the roofs that my trees will make.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His eyes had been on the far distance, but
he turned to fix them intently on Beatrice’s.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you live on a mountain,” he said, “you
can see much more than if you belong to the
crowded, pushing, hurrying people that stay
in the valley.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And now,” he declared, after a little pause,
“here I have talked and talked just as Miriam
said I would, but I want you to have a turn.
You have told us your name and that you know
John Herrick, but may I hear the rest?
Where are you living and how did you happen
to come to Ely? Strangers are not so common
but that we backwoods people like to
know all about them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Rather to her own surprise Beatrice found
herself telling not only what she hoped he
would do for her aunt, but all about why they
had come to Ely, even to her own puzzle as
to what Aunt Anna’s special reason had been
for insisting so earnestly that she would not
go away. She told him of the strike, of her
acquaintance with Christina, the visit of Dabney
Mills, and her new-found friendship with
Hester Herrick. He looked concerned over
some portions of her tale and smiled over
others. He laughed aloud when she described
the midnight departure of Joe Ling.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You were right to give up when he went
away,” he commented. “The Chinamen in
these valleys seem to know everything and
just when to get out of the way of trouble.
I know Joe. He has a little house and truck
garden outside of Ely. He will stay there
quietly until, in his own strange way, he has
found out that the disturbance is over for
good, and then he will come back.” He
nodded with satisfaction when she spoke of
the Herricks.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am glad you know them,” he said. “We—we
think a lot of Hester ourselves, and
John Herrick—there are few men I like and
admire as much.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I like them too,” agreed Beatrice. “I
don’t understand just how they belong to each
other; she says he isn’t really her father.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’ll not forget,” Dr. Minturn began
slowly; “I’ll not forget in a long time the day
I first saw John Herrick. I was up at the
edge of the woods where you found me and
he came riding down the trail: had been riding
all night or longer than that, perhaps. By
the look on his face I could see that black
trouble rode behind him and that he had not
been able to gallop away from it. I didn’t
say much to him, but I brought him home—he
and the horse were dead tired—and we got
him to stay with us for three days, until that
strained look began to disappear from his face.
I didn’t know what had happened to him and
I didn’t dare to ask. That was ten years ago
and I know him nearly as well as I know myself,
but I have never asked him yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And did he have Hester with him then?”
Beatrice asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bless you, no. Hester lived with us. She
was born at our house and her mother died
there; her father had died before. They were
some far kin of Miriam’s, and we kept the
baby when the others were gone. Our own
two children were grown up and married, so
we were glad enough to have her ourselves.
She was six years old, a fat, merry little thing,
and the way she and John took to each other
would do your heart good. He would sit on
the door-stone and play with her for hours,
or they would take walks together, up and
down the rows of pine-trees, the first ones that
had been planted then. He came back to see
us many times, for he rode back and forth
among the mountains, looking at mines, buying
up ranches. Everything he touched
seemed to prosper, but he never looked happy.
It was a whole year after, that he came one
day and said he wanted Hester.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, how could you give her up?” exclaimed
Beatrice.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought I couldn’t,” returned the doctor
rather glumly, “and I vowed I wouldn’t,
but Miriam said to me, ‘Look at his face, can’t
you see how he needs her?’ and of course in
the end I had to give in. The care of a small
child was really too much for Miriam. If
John had not seen that, he would never have
asked for her. Herrick is better off than we;
he can do a great deal for Hester that we
never could. While she has been growing up
she has had everything that a sensible rich
man’s money could give her. He built that
house just for her, and, oh, he is a lonely man
in it when she is away at school. She came
back to stay with us when he went overseas
during the war, but they surely were glad to
be together again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you never knew where he came from?”
the girl questioned wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Neither that nor what trouble drove him
to our mountains. We don’t go too deep into
a man’s past in the West. We like him and
stand by him for what he is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was quite dark now, and a white blot,
moving through the dusk toward them, proved
to be Mrs. Minturn’s gown, as her quiet voice
presently proved.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sure the doctor must have told you the
history of every tree by now, even to the ones
that the badgers dug up and the rows the
deer nibbled. It is time you both came in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only think, she lives in the cabin where you
planted the pansies,” her husband returned
as he raised his long length from the bank
where they had been sitting.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, did you plant them?” asked Beatrice.
“I believe they were what made me love the
place the first time I saw it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, it was I that put them there. We
had been over to see Hester and I had bought
a basketful of the plants in Ely, though the
doctor laughed at me and said I had no room
for them in the crowded garden. He was
quite right, so, when Hester and I took a
walk while he was talking business with John,
we happened to go by the cabin and it looked
so lonely that I just stopped and we planted
the pansies by the steps. I am glad they are
growing. And now you must come in for
you need sleep, I know. As I say, the doctor
loves to talk of his trees but I feel sure he has
told you everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“All but one thing,” Dr. Minturn said as
he tucked Miriam’s arm under his and turned
toward the house. “That is, that Christmas-tree
Hill is to belong to Hester some day
when you and I can’t enjoy it any more.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER VI <br /> OLAF</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Sped by the kindly farewells of Miriam,
Beatrice and Dr. Minturn set out next
day on their return ride across the pass and
reached the cabin without undue adventure.
During the doctor’s long interview with Aunt
Anna, the two girls sat beside the fire, holding
each other’s hands tightly, neither speaking a
word to voice her hopes or fears. When the
doctor came out, however, one glimpse of his
smiling face was enough to cheer them both.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nothing seriously wrong,” was his verdict,
“and you have brought her to just the climate
and just the sort of life to make her well.”
He gave them long and careful directions as
to what they were to do and then got up to
say good-by. “I am going over to John
Herrick’s to spend the night, and I will see
you again before I go back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He visited the village also before his departure,
for he seemed interested in the progress
of the trouble there. He had a long talk
with Nancy and Beatrice out under the pines
beside the stream the next morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your aunt will get well,” he assured them.
“She is anxious and unhappy and troubled, besides
her illness. You say that you don’t understand
why, but in time she may tell you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Did she tell you?” Nancy asked him suddenly
for he was the sort of person to invite
confidences.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, she told me very little, but old doctors
guess a great deal. She will tell you herself
some day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He went on to explain that a sleeping-porch
must be added to the cabin, since it was imperative
that she sleep out of doors.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I spoke about it to John Herrick and he
can send some one over to build it for you,”
he said. “Old Tim who works for him is a
carpenter of sorts, though he is rather tottery
and slow and you must not be impatient if
the work seems to drag. Now I believe that
is all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish I could tell you——” Beatrice began
as he got up. She wanted to thank him
for breaking out of his long retirement and
rendering services for which he would accept
no fee. He cut short her halting words at once.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t want to hear anything about that,”
he declared. “Just be careful of your aunt
and get her confidence if you can. I will be
here again before so very long. That situation
in the village bears watching and I want
to see how it turns out. I never saw anything
quite like it—all the idle men wrangling
and quarreling, since there is no one outside
to quarrel with. The fellow that got away
with the money and shut down the works, he
is the one they are after, but since neither
they nor the sheriff nor that clever reporter
fellow can find him, they have to take out
their bad humor on one another. It is a dangerous
place, a town full of ugly-tempered
men, especially when they have some one like
that Thorvik to keep the agitation boiling.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But who could have taken the money?”
asked Nancy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Blessed if I know,” returned the doctor.
“There wasn’t even a masked man with a
black horse and a pair of automatics such as
the movies tell us belong to an affair like that.
Well, I must be getting back to Miriam.
Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He clambered, with his awkward length,
into the saddle, and set off, leaving the girls
much lighter of heart than they had been before
his visit. It would be hard to measure
the extent of their gratitude.</p>

<p class='c004'>Next day old Tim, with his tools over his
shoulder and a creaking wagon-load of lumber
following him up to the gate, came to begin
on the sleeping-porch. It was quite true that
he worked very slowly and that after ten days
the porch was still not finished, but his efforts
to make everything as comfortable as possible
were so earnest that the girls could not grow
impatient with him. At the end of that time
he appeared one morning with a helper, a
broad-shouldered boy of about eighteen with
tow-colored hair and the widest and most
friendly smile Beatrice had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who is he? Did he come from the village?”
she asked, but old Tim answered evasively.
He was just some one staying at John Herrick’s
for a while, and he thought he would
come over and help. Beyond that she could
learn nothing, although she noticed that when
supplies were wanted from Ely it was always
old Tim who went for them, never his younger
helper. The boy worked hard and was as shy
of speech as Tim was fluent. After his coming
the building went on rapidly. All sorts
of improvements were added besides the porch.
Cupboards in the kitchen had been demanded
by Nancy, but they had not dreamed of dormer-windows
for their little rooms under the
roof, high-backed settles for the fireplace, and
a palatial box stall for Buck. The request
“for a few shelves for pots and kettles” was
materialized into a spacious pantry rich in cupboards,
shelves, drawers, and pegs for the
hanging of each utensil and into a transformed
kitchen with everything rearranged to the
great increase of comfort and convenience.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We wanted John Herrick to come over
and see what we had done,” Tim said one day,
“but somehow he doesn’t do it, though he is
always asking about the work. A lot of the
things we have done were his suggestion.
Those sliding shutters on the porch were his
special idea. There couldn’t be anything better
to keep out the rain and snow.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Snow?” echoed Nancy, who was standing
beside him to admire his work as he loved to
have her do. “Why, we are only going to be
here for the summer!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It can snow any day it wants to in these
mountains,” Tim returned. “There’s more
in January than in June, to be sure, but you
may wake up any morning and find the ground
white. It can snow just as easy as rain hereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice had been watching Tim’s helper
keenly from day to day with a growing suspicion
lurking in her mind. Besides giving
assistance with the building he came to the
house daily with the milk and eggs that Hester
supplied. One morning when she was astir
early she saw him meet Christina on the path
below the house and watched him take from
her the basket in which she was bringing their
marketing. In the thin quiet air their voices
came up to her window more clearly than they
seemed to realize.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Isn’t it too heavy?” he questioned. “And
you’re looking pale and tired. That—that
Thorvik has been abusing you again. I’d like
to get my hands on him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, no,” cried Christina in terror, “you
must not let him or any one in the village see
you. You promised John Herrick you would
not go near the town until he found out how
things stood for you. He said it was safer
and easier that no one at all should know you
were here. Thorvik does not harm me; it is
only the—the things he says about my good
friends.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t stand by and see him make you
miserable,” protested the boy hotly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You promised,” repeated Christina obstinately.
“You can’t break the word you
gave.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then some day I will be giving John Herrick
his promise back again,” he returned, his
voice rising louder. “Thorvik will find——”</p>

<p class='c004'>Christina, glancing anxiously at the windows,
warned him to silence. They went together
into the kitchen, leaving Beatrice to
ponder what she had heard.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That letter to Olaf got such a quick answer
that it must have found him just back
from a voyage,” she was reflecting. “And
we never read what he wrote. It must have
been to say that he was coming home. I suppose
they kept his being here a secret even
from us so that if any one asked us we would
not know. There is always that Dabney
Mills hanging about trying to find out
things.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The day was so full that she had little time
to talk of the matter with Nancy until they
sat by the fire late that evening. The blaze
was always a grateful one on these nights that
grew so chilly the moment the sun was gone.
Aunt Anna had finally gone to bed on the
new sleeping-porch, Nancy sat on one of
Tim’s settles by the hearth, knitting busily,
while Beatrice, openly idle and dreaming,
sat opposite gazing into the changing flames.
Her mind was running afar upon such various
things that even now she did not come immediately
to the question of Christina’s son.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Nancy,” she said, “don’t you begin to feel
like an entirely different person from the one
you were when we came here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her sister nodded in quick assent.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never knew before that I could do so—so
much <i>thinking</i>,” she agreed rather vaguely.
“I am busy every minute but there is time to
turn things over in my mind, ever so many
things about you and Aunt Anna and dad
and myself and, oh—just about living. When
I look back at last winter and all the time
before, it seems as though we were always in
a crowd of people, people who were all talking
at once and all wanting me to do something
with them in a hurry. I liked it, but I never
had time to think about anything at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” returned Beatrice slowly, “there was
always something to do and somewhere to go
and that seemed all there was to living.
Think of my head being so full of things that
I forgot about having an uncle. I must have
seen him and have heard dad and Aunt Anna
talk of him, but I never noticed it at last when
he never came any more and was never mentioned.
But I think about him now. I
think about him more—and more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy laid down her knitting and leaned
forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you?” she questioned. “So do I. Do
you think it could be because of him, someway,
that Aunt Anna wanted to come here?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It may be,” said Beatrice, “but, if it is, where
is he?”</p>

<p class='c004'>They looked at each other, an unspoken
question in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is another thing,” pursued Beatrice.
“That boy who has been helping Tim is
Christina’s son Olaf. I had thought so before
but to-day I am certain.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had been suspecting that too,” said
Nancy. “One day I asked her if she didn’t
want us to write her another letter, and she
laughed, so happily, and said, ‘Not just yet.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>The door from the bedroom opened softly
and Aunt Anna came in. Her cheeks were
pink from the fresh air outside, her fair hair
was ruffled, and she was wrapped in the dark
fur robe that the girls had laid over her bed.
She looked very pretty as she sat in the big
chair that they pulled out for her, the glow of
the fire lighting her face.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I heard your voices,” she said, “and,
though it is glorious out there with the sound
of the water and with the tops of the trees
showing against the stars, I was not able to
sleep, so I thought I would come in and talk
to you a little.” She leaned back in her chair
and sighed blissfully. “What good care you
take of me and how well I feel! I do not
seem to be the same person.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girls laughed in unison, it was so like
what they had been saying.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Beatrice,” her aunt went on suddenly,
“Dr. Minturn told me about your falling over
the cliff when you went to fetch him for me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was not much of a cliff,” returned
Beatrice sheepishly, involuntarily rubbing the
bruised elbow that was now the one memento
of her misadventure. She had meant to keep
that incident from Aunt Anna’s knowledge.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It frightened me,” her aunt said, “but it
opened my eyes to what you were willing to
do for me. We are all of us changed and we
are all beginning to understand one another
better. At home, with your rounds of shopping
and motoring and dancing, I used to
think we were not much more than casually
acquainted. And there was something of
which I always wanted to talk to you, but I
wondered if a day would ever come when you
would have time to listen and understand. I
did not want you to hear unless you could see
it all as clearly as I did myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And do you think,” asked Beatrice, her
voice low and eager, “do you believe that the
time has come now?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” was the answer, “I think the time
has come now. It is right that you should
hear at last what has been hanging heavy on
my heart for these ten years—about why I
came here—about my brother.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER VII <br /> “MY BROTHER JACK”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“I have often wondered,” Aunt Anna began
her story that was to explain so much
that the girls had not understood; “I have
often wondered that you did not remember
your uncle, my younger brother Jack.
When you talked of things you had done when
you were small children, I used to listen
hungrily, hoping you might speak of him, but
you never did. He was with us a great deal
when you were little things, and he was always
in the nursery or playing with you in the garden,
for he loved children. That was soon
after I came to live with you, and when he
was in college, studying to be an engineer.
He spent all his vacations with us: I wish you
had not been too young to remember.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice wrinkled her brows and vainly
searched for a fleeting recollection.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t remember anything clearly,” she
said at last. “There has been so much between.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“When my brother left college he went to
work immediately and was so eager and interested
in his first ‘job.’ It was the building
of a dam and reservoir for the water supply
of a town near us, a project that was being
financed by the company of which your father
is a director. It was through his means that
Jack was put in charge of the work, although
he was very young for such responsibility, too
young, I insisted at the time. And it was
proved that he was too young. He did his
work well, he was a brilliant engineer, but he
trusted too much to the honor of other people
and he—he did not take things as an older man
would.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She paused, and Nancy, putting down her
knitting, came to sit on the floor beside her
chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Poor Aunt Anna,” she said, “did something
dreadful happen?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly her aunt nodded, looking steadily into
the fire, as though tears might come should
she allow her eyes to waver.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she answered, “something happened
that has darkened my life, every day of it,
for all these years.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We did not see so much of my brother
after he began working, for he was absorbed
and busy. As is usual in such cases, a contractor
was doing the work under his planning
and his supervision. Things went very
well—for some months. Then one day, like
a thunderclap, came the news that the project
was being carried on with gross dishonesty.
A great deal more money had been advanced
for the work than had actually been spent on
construction, false records of costs had been
turned in, machinery ordered and not paid for,
debts incurred on every side, with many thousands
of dollars completely vanished. Some
one, it was evident, had been pocketing the
difference, and an immediate investigation was
set on foot.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was a terrible blow to your father. I
do not know myself what he thought when
the facts first became known, but he at once
asked some of his fellow-directors to meet at
his house and said that Jack would be there
to explain matters to them before there should
be a formal meeting of the whole board next
day. They called me in to act as secretary,
since they wanted a record kept but desired
the whole affair to be kept private. I can
remember how my knees shook as I went in
and sat down at the end of the library table.
There were five men there, most of them gray-headed,
all of them unspeaking, even your
father. I was in a wild hurry to have Jack
come. I wanted the matter cleared quickly.
I could hardly keep from crying out in the
storm of impatience and suspense I felt during
those minutes we waited.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He came at last and I can shut my eyes
and see him still, standing before that group
of grave men, so young, so white-faced and
excited, so eager to explain. They asked him
questions and he answered them in the
straight-forward way he always had. They
looked more serious and questioned him again,
while my hands shook as I wrote down the answers,
they were so frank and open, and they
were doing him so much harm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Why had he not gone over the accounts
more thoroughly?’</p>

<p class='c004'>“He had felt that his work was the scientific
end of the enterprise. He had left financial
matters almost entirely to the contractor, who,
so he had considered, was completely honest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Did he suspect the man now?’</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was plain from the misappropriation of
the funds that the man had been robbing them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Yes, but could he offer material proof that
it was the contractor, and he alone, who had
been pocketing the money?’</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, he had no proof, so far.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He was so inexperienced, so sure that every
one was as honorable as he, so certain that
everybody had equal faith in him. He was
half-way through the interview before he realized
what they suspected.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I had thought, when he came in, how much
of a boy he was still. Then, all in one moment,
I saw him grow to be a man. The idea
that they might consider him guilty seemed to
deal him a staggering blow, as though some
one had actually struck him between the eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘You believe that I have profited by this
dirty business, you think that my own hands
are not clean?’ he cried out suddenly, and
waited a long minute for some one to answer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In every group there is always at least
one man of a certain type, hard, inflexible,
strict with himself, and merciless to others.
Robert Kirby was the man of that sort in our
company that day. He sat at the opposite
end of the table from me, and I had watched
him nervously as he turned his little sharp
eyes on Jack and never moved them from
his face. By some terrible mischance it was he
who found words first.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘After all you have said,’ he declared in
his cutting voice, ‘it would be hard for any of
us to believe otherwise.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“Jack wheeled to your father and faced him,
not with a question, but an accusation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘You believe it too!’ he cried.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your father is slow of speech at best and
he was excited and upset. He voiced his faith
in his brother, but he spoke a second too late.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘You all of you believe it, every one. It is
because your eyes are as blind as the dollars
you are always counting.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“He turned so quickly to the door that no
one could stop him. I was the only one that
managed to move as he flung it open.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘Not I.’ With all my strength I called it
after him as I stood up in my place at the end
of the table. ‘Oh Jack, not I!’</p>

<p class='c004'>“But the door had slammed so quickly that
I think he did not hear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We all sat very still, unable to speak, ashamed
even to look at one another. Robert
Kirby again was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘He should be stopped; he must be put under
arrest,’ he said, but your father got up
and stood with his back against the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘If it is true that my brother is guilty, and
Heaven grant it is not so,’ he declared, ‘all the
money shall be repaid at once. This matter
is to go no farther.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“We never saw Jack again. Your father
had a letter from him, saying that of course
he considered himself responsible for the losses
to the company since his own folly had
brought them about. ‘Other people may think
I am guilty if they like. If you and Anna do
not believe in me I do not care what decision
Robert Kirby and his friends come to,’ he
added. He had disposed of all the property
left to him by our father and was turning over
the sum realized to cover the defaulted amount.
There was a little lacking, a few hundred dollars,
and this he was obliged—you could see
even in that business-like letter how it hurt him
to do so—to ask your father to advance. In
return he was delivering to him the title deeds
‘to that piece of land in Montana, Anna can
tell you about it, there is no time to sell that
in a hurry and I want this infernal business
closed.’ That was the only letter we ever received
from him, and that was ten years ago.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The land he spoke of was this bit of hillside,
with the cabin, where we are living now.
We took a gay journey, during one of Jack’s
vacations, just vaguely ‘West’ because he had
always said there was the best opening for a
man in the Western States, and he hoped to
live there some day. His grandmother had
given him a thousand dollars, ‘just to see how
he would invest it,’ she said, and was a little
dismayed when he came back and told her he
had purchased a part of a mountain in Montana.
We had been to the Coast; we had
seen the Grand Cañon and Yellowstone Park.
It was a man we met in the Park who persuaded
Jack to buy this piece of land, saying
that the timber on it was worth a good deal
and there was always the chance of a mine.
We come over to see the purchase and spent a
day in Ely, though most of it was put in
riding through the hills and scrambling over
as many steep trails as we could find. We
climbed so high we could see valley after valley
spread out below us, and the air was so
clear one felt that it was possible to see halfway
round the world if only the mountains
did not block the way. There were two or three
riders scattered over the trail below, tiny
black figures like toys, although everything
was so still we could hear their voices shouting
to one another and could hear the plunge
and splash of a waterfall a mile away. It had
been snowing on the peaks, but where we were
it was hot in the blazing sunshine. Jack sat
staring, staring, and staring into the valley
and at last he said:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anna, from a height like this you ought
to be able to see what sort of a place the
world really is.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have never forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A burning pine cone fell from the heap of
coals and rolled out on the hearth. Beatrice,
who had been listening so intently that she
had not moved, rose now and fell to mending
the fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And did you never find any trace of him?”
Nancy gently brought Aunt Anna back to her
story.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Never, my dear, though we tried in every
way you could imagine. He was determined
to disappear out of our lives, and we were not
able to prevent it. A year or two later the
same contractor was proved to be connected
with some such scandalous frauds that he was
sent to the penitentiary. The first matter was
dropped on account of your father’s influence
and the fact that Jack had made restitution, so
that the man was bolder when he tried again.
Your father had made some effort to procure
proof against him, but there was nothing definite
enough to exonerate Jack before the
world. When the man was finally convicted,
we thought that must surely clear my brother’s
name. Yet I was present when your
father laid the facts before Robert Kirby, who
only grunted and said that nothing could convince
him that they had not worked together
the first time. When I say my prayers and
come to the place where we must forgive our
enemies, I have to struggle with myself all
over again to forgive Robert Kirby, although
all the time I know him to be nothing
but a misled, ignorant, obstinate old
man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would call him something worse,” declared
Nancy with heat.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was quiet for a little as they all sat
thinking.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And did you think that you might find him
here, Aunt Anna?” Beatrice finally asked
slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought we might find him or get news
of him. When the doctor said this year I
must go away or—or not get well, I vowed
that, if it were the last thing I did, I would
look for him once more. He loved this place
so much that I always felt, somehow, that he
would come back to it. We had written to
him here, but the letters came back to us with
word that no such person was to be found; and
your father made inquiries when he came to get
us a house. He did not approve much of our
settling down here for the summer, but I was
determined and he had to give way.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yet we almost had to go back,” Nancy observed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, if it had not been for Beatrice’s thinking
of the cabin and for her courage in bringing us here,
we would have had to give it up.
And so far we have heard nothing, but I cannot
help hoping that we still may.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But why, Aunt Anna, why did you never
tell us before?” Beatrice put the question with
the same puzzled frown she had worn when
the story began.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wanted to, but I could not bear to.
You were always so hurried and so deep in affairs
of your own, as is the natural thing. To
tell you and have you think, even for a fleeting
minute, that my brother did wrong—that
would have been beyond endurance. He is
only a name to you, and after all, as Robert
Kirby says, nothing has ever been proved. But
you <i>must</i> believe in my brother; you <i>must</i>.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She leaned back and a slow tear of weariness
and long-endured misery rolled down her
cheek. The recital had tired her far more than
they had realized, so that Nancy, suddenly
taking alarm, whisked her away to bed.
There, with many loving pats and hugs and
words of affectionate comfort, they at last
saw her ready for sleep.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet Beatrice, lying broad awake in her
little room, watching the curtains flutter in
the windy dark, could not put from her mind
the thought of what she had heard. Presently
she got up to steal into Nancy’s room opposite
and see how she was faring. She found that
the bed was empty and that her sister was
kneeling by the window, staring out into the
forest. A solitary coyote was yelping in the
woods, but it was a sound to which they had
become so accustomed that it was doubtful if
they even heard it. The pale light of a late
moon showed the moving tree-tops, the dark
chasm of the stream, and, hardly to be discerned
among the pines, the square chimney
stacks and one tiny light that marked the place
of John Herrick’s house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t stay there in the cold,” remonstrated
Beatrice. “You can’t see anything or—or
anybody in the middle of the night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I know it,” sighed Nancy as she turned
from the window. “I was just thinking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She climbed on the bed and sat with her
knees humped and her arm flung around them,
still staring, as though fascinated, out through
the window toward that slope of the mountain
where John Herrick lived.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He doesn’t look like dad or Aunt Anna,”
Beatrice protested suddenly, with no apparent
connection with anything that had been said.
“No, he isn’t like them at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe not,” returned Nancy inscrutably,
“but he has that same light yellow hair that
she has. If Aunt Anna were very sunburnt
or he were very pale—it might be—that they
would not be so very different.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER VIII <br /> MRS. BRUIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Although the girls had talked so late
of Aunt Anna’s story and the strange
thought they had concerning it, they were up
early next morning and still discussing the
matter busily as they prepared breakfast.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The question is,” said Nancy, plying her
egg-beater with vigor, “shall we tell Aunt
Anna what we think?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If we should be mistaken, and John Herrick
should turn out to be, oh, just anybody,
she would be so disappointed. Perhaps we
had better wait.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They had hardly finished breakfast when
there was a knock at the door, followed by
Dr. Minturn’s tall presence on the threshold.
He inspected his patient and announced a very
great improvement, and then said he must go
on at once, since he hoped to visit the town
and start back over the mountain that same
day. Beatrice walked down with him through
the pines, for he had tied his horse at the gate.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your aunt seems less worried and far more
cheerful than before,” he said.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” assented Beatrice, “I think it is because
she has told us at last why she came.”
She went on to give the substance of Aunt
Anna’s story.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I surmised it was something like that,” he
observed when he had heard her to the end,
“and I have been thinking about it ever since.
I don’t know any man in this neighborhood by
the name of Deems but—I believe he is not
so far away after all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice looked at him steadily.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe that too,” she said.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dr. Minturn stopped, for they had reached
the bars, but he made no move to mount his
horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m going to give you some advice that
isn’t medical,” he began. “I think more of
John Herrick than of any other man in the
world, barring my own son, perhaps, and I
love Hester as though she were mine. And
you three here, your aunt and your sister and
you, I have come to think of you all as better
friends than I had ever thought to make again.
Your aunt—why, she has more pluck in one
inch of that little sick body of hers than I
have in my whole big self, and her girls aren’t
far behind her. I’d like to see her have what
she wants, I’d like to see you all happy.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He drew a long breath and spoke lower.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Whatever you think is or isn’t so,” he
warned, “don’t—press anybody too hard, don’t
push some one by letting him know too quickly
that you have guessed who he is. Your aunt
is eager and overwrought; who wouldn’t be,
after ten years of anxiety and sorrow? She
and you might be in too much of a hurry and
ruin everything. John thinks he is safe under
his assumed name and with your aunt too ill
to be about. He knows who you are and perhaps
why you have come, but he can’t yet
make up his mind to conquer his stubborn
pride. Give him time, that is all I say, give
him time. He rode away into the hills the first
day he saw you, but he must have thought
things out up there in the mountains, for he
came back again. But he can’t come all the
way yet.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you think he ever will?” Beatrice asked
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, I think he will. Does your aunt have
any suspicion of who he is?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am sure she hasn’t,” Beatrice declared.
“She thinks of him as Hester’s father, some
one too old to be her brother. No, she doesn’t
dream it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then don’t tell her and don’t tell him,” he
urged. “Wait until John is ready to tell her
himself. You must go gently with a man who
has been hurt to his very soul.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice held out her brown hand and the
doctor shook it solemnly. She watched him
ride away; then returned to the house to saddle
Buck and set off presently up the mountain.
Her mind was full of new, excited hopes that
seemed to dance to the music of Buck’s flying
feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy, meanwhile, was not thinking so much
of their new problem. She had the faculty of
being completely absorbed in the object in
hand and to-day that object was a cake.
Christina had given her a Scandinavian recipe,
dwelling so much on the unusual deliciousness
of the result that Nancy could scarcely wait
to try it. With the greatest of care she mixed
and measured and weighed and stirred.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is rather a long cake,” she reflected after
she had spent an hour combining the ingredients,
but she felt certain that the completed
dish would amply repay her toil.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had just got it into the oven when a
knock sounded on the kitchen door to announce
the boy whom Hester had sent with
a basket of eggs.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Thank you, Olaf,” she said as he set them
down; then flushed since she had not meant
to speak his name. The color flooded his face
also. “I beg your pardon,” she added quickly.
“We have been guessing who you were, but
we didn’t mean to pry into any secrets.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It does not matter,” he assured her. “My
mother and John Herrick made me promise
that I would not go to the village while things
were so upset, since he says there is no use in
stirring up bad feeling again. Your sister’s
letter caught me in San Francisco, just as I
was to sail; but I couldn’t help coming home,
once I knew that my mother really wanted to
see me. But I don’t like this hiding away, and
I only agreed to it because I would do anything
John Herrick says.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Old Tim came in to put away his tools and
to sit down upon the doorstep for a moment
to rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t think of another thing to do to
this cabin,” he confessed. “I have to own that
it is time for me to go home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was just getting up to take his leave
when a step was heard on the path and Dabney
Mills came around the corner of the house,
smiling and quite unabashed by any memories
of his departure some days before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I heard voices,” he said, “so I just thought
I wouldn’t disturb any one by knocking at
the front door and would——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Would see if you couldn’t overhear something,”
Tim cut him short. “Well, we’re not
speaking of anything you shouldn’t hear, so
our talk wouldn’t interest you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He walked away leaving the intruding youth
looking after him in speechless indignation.
Nancy turned to the stove to look at her cake.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know this gentleman,” she heard
Dabney say, staring at Olaf, and she heard
Tim reply over his shoulder, “Nor do you
need to know him, so far as I can see.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I heard you talk of going berrying the
other day, Miss Nancy,” Olaf said, coming to
the door and quite disregarding the inquisitive
reporter. “This is the best sort of a day for it,
and I can show you just where to go. Your
sister is coming up the hill, so your aunt won’t
be left alone. Wouldn’t you like to come?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I would indeed! Will you excuse us?” she
added politely to Dabney Mills, to which he
gave a gruff assent and stalked out of sight
around the corner of the house. She felt anxious
to escape from his questions, and was
sure that, in the hands of the determined Beatrice,
he could find out very little. She fetched
her hat and her basket and set off gaily, since
to look for berries had been a cherished project
for some days.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If I could just square off and hit him,”
Olaf said regretfully looking back for a final
glare at Dabney, “that might settle him once
for all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” Nancy returned wisely, “it would only
begin a lot of trouble that would involve more
people than yourself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“So John Herrick says,” the boy agreed
with a sigh, “though it still seems to me the
simplest way out of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They scrambled up the hill, out beyond the
shadow of the pines to the open pasture land
where the trees had been cut, where the new
growth was springing up, and where among
the old stumps the berry bushes and
vines matted the ground. It was a hot
summer day, very still, except for the grasshoppers
singing shrilly, but not with that peaceful
drowsy heat that Nancy knew. The air was
far too bracing for any one to feel lazy or
sleepy as on the summer days at home. The
blue distances shimmered, the sky was cloudless,
everything seemed to stir and throb with
the energy of living. The baskets filled rapidly
as the two went from one patch to another,
climbing higher and higher up the mountain.
Suddenly Olaf glanced over his shoulder and
then turned about quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just look there,” he said in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>Something like a big black dog was moving
among the bushes, its smooth round back showing
now and again above the tangled thicket.
Presently, as it crossed an open space, Nancy
saw it more clearly, with its small head, clumsy
feet, and odd shuffling walk. She had never
seen a bear at large before.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh,” she breathed, and dropped her basket.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no need to be afraid,” Olaf assured
her. “A bear won’t bother you at all if you
leave him alone. They have ugly tempers,
and if you once make them angry they will
follow you a long way to get even. But this
one won’t hurt us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The creature, at first quite unconscious of
their presence, went slowly along, snuffing
among the roots, turning over stones to lick
up the ants beneath them. Finally observing
them, it stood on its hind legs to peer over a
clump of bushes, looking so much like a shy,
but inquisitive boy that Nancy laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, see, there’s another, two little ones,”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Olaf looked where she pointed and took up
the baskets hastily. “If there are cubs it is
quite a different thing,” he said quickly. “A
mother bear never does anything you think
she will. It would be better for us to go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The bear stood watching their hasty departure
for a moment; then, with a grunt, dropped
on all fours again and turned once more to the
pursuit of her dinner. Nancy, looking back,
caught sight of the fat, round cubs as they
came scampering forward to run at their mother’s
heels. One of them tumbled over and
rolled upon the grass, whereupon its mother
turned to lick it affectionately and give it a
friendly cuff with her big paw. Evidently she
considered the incident, so far as human beings
were concerned, as being quite closed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice and Hester were at the cabin when
the two berry pickers returned. They declared
that they had seen nothing of Dabney
Mills, who had apparently taken himself
off. They had a hilarious lunch, during which
Beatrice imitated the airs and graces of the insistent
reporter, while Nancy, as she waited on
the table, assumed the shuffling mannerisms
of Joe Ling. Aunt Anna declared herself so
worn out with laughing at them that she retired
early for her nap, and Beatrice presently,
after Hester was gone, went upstairs to sleep
also. Nancy spent a large part of the afternoon
finishing her cake, for even the icing,
with its alternate layers of brown and white
was a work of art in itself. Finally the task
was completed, however, and the dish set to
cool on the window-ledge. When at last it became
time to think about the evening meal she
discovered that she needed fresh kindling for
the fire and went out to the shed to fetch it.
She opened the door and started back with a
cry of surprise. Seated on the straw, with his
back to the wall and his note-book on his knee,
was Dabney Mills.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I heard that fellow, Olaf you call him, say
that he was coming back at four o’clock with
the milk, so I came back to have a word with
him when we shouldn’t be disturbed. I’ve
been waiting quite a while. He’s late,” he declared
crossly. He got up and walked stiffly
to the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Say,” he exclaimed, “What’s that beside
your window. I do believe it’s a bear!”
His tone was one of undisguised dismay.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where?” said Nancy, running out after
him. “Oh, my cake, my cake!” she cried in
distress.</p>

<p class='c004'>The same creature that she and Olaf had
seen when they were berrying had come down
the hill and was running an investigating and
appreciative tongue over the icing of the precious
cake. She had been used, perhaps, to
prowl about the cabin when it was empty and
was now making herself very much at home.
Although plainly pleased with her refreshment,
she dropped down when she heard their
voices and began to shamble off toward the
sheltering underbrush.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Let her go quietly,” Nancy warned, “don’t
disturb her, don’t, <i>don’t</i>!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Dabney Mills plucking up courage at the
animal’s willingness to depart, was attempting
to speed her going by throwing stones after
her. Picking up a square block of wood from
beside the shed, he flung it with unfortunate
success, in spite of Nancy’s catching at his arm.
It caught the bear full on the side of the head.</p>

<p class='c004'>She turned, bared all her teeth in an angry
snarl, and rushed upon them. Without ceremony
they fled, past the shed, away from the
house, and up the hill. To reach the safety of
the cabin, they would have to pass by her,
which at the moment was unthinkable. Therefore,
as the angry creature climbed steadily
after them, they were forced further and further
up toward the open spaces of the mountain.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I’m not afraid. She won’t hurt us,”
Nancy kept telling herself, though her teeth
were chattering and her breath was coming
short. Bewildered as she was, she still had
presence of mind enough to try to bend their
course in a circle so that at last they might
come nearer home. But no such coolness possessed
her companion. Excited, almost hysterical
with terror, he shouted at the bear,
waved his arms, and threw sticks and stones at
her every time the steep trail afforded him opportunity.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stop, don’t, you are only making it worse,”
Nancy begged him breathlessly, but he was
far too terrified to pay any heed to her words.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy felt that there could be nothing more
terrible than this big swaying body that
came up the hill after them, the little pointed
head with its white teeth showing, its small
eyes blazing with an animal’s unreasoning fury.
She was panting and exhausted, her knees
shook under her, it seemed utterly impossible
to go farther. One last hope flashed through
her mind: it was the hour for Olaf to bring the
milk and he might be somewhere below, coming
through the pines. She hollowed her
hands before her mouth and, with a final effort
of her panting lungs, shouted with all her
might:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Olaf, Olaf.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A faint hail came in answer. How far
away it was! Would he know what had happened?</p>

<p class='c004'>There was only a little further for them to
climb, for a long ridge of rock, shouldering
up through the underbrush, cut off their ascent
with its smooth wall that offered no foothold.
Beside it the mountain-side fell away in
a sheer drop of a hundred feet of precipice so
that their retreat was blocked completely. A
vast furry form rose through the bushes beside
them, and the bear struck at them with her
great paw. Nancy was too bewildered to understand
how Dabney Mills came suddenly
to be behind her, while she was thrust forward
into the very face of their enemy. The
blow missed her, however, and struck the boy,
just where she could not see. With a strange
sickening sigh, he dropped and rolled toward
the edge of the cliff. Nancy flattened herself
against the rock wall, staring, fascinated, as
the bear settled her haunches firmly, seemed
to pause a moment, and then squared off to
strike at her again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER IX <br /> A DECISION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was not easy for either Nancy or Olaf
to give any connected account afterward
of their adventure with the bear. Nancy
could never describe it clearly at all, and Olaf,
when questioned, gave a very simple version
of the rescue.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I saw the bear striking at them when I
came near, so I just whanged her over the
head with the milk-bucket, and she beat it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Dabney Mills, who had no knowledge at the
time of what was happening, was able, perhaps,
to give the most picturesque story of
the three. Not even he, however, was able
to deny that it was the milk-pail that saved
the day. Olaf had been carrying it on his
arm when he heard Nancy’s frantic cry for
help, and he had never thought of setting it
down, nor did he spill quite all of the contents
as he ran to help her. He had come panting
up the slope, just in time to see the bear’s blow
graze the girl’s shoulder and rip away her
sleeve. Being still out of reach, he had hurled
the unwieldy tin bucket with all his might and
with most successful aim. The clanging blow
with which it struck startled Nancy, and the
unexpected spectacle of a stream of white milk
pouring over those black, furry shoulders
made her feel that she had been bereft of her
senses.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I have seen,” she said when she was
trying to relate the tale to Beatrice, “what nobody
else ever saw; I have seen a bear look
surprised.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Astonishment and horror seemed, indeed, to
take instant possession of Mrs. Bruin, for she
dropped from the ledge and made off through
the bushes. The milk-pail, dislodged from
where it had caught among the stones, rolled
clanging and banging after her with a noise
that lent even greater speed to her flight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Olaf and Nancy stared at each other for a
moment while his anxious face relaxed slowly
into a broad grin and she burst out into irrepressible
giggles. The strain of the terrible
minutes that had just passed broke down suddenly
into uncontrollable mirth so that gale
after gale of laughter swept over them both.
Nancy was so breathless from her desperate
climb that laughing was painful, yet she could
not check it and was forced to sit down upon
the grass and lean against the rock wall in her
helplessness. Olaf recovered first, rubbed his
eyes, wet with laughter, on the sleeve of his
coat, and was able to speak quite soberly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“After all, it isn’t so funny,” he observed.
He leaned far out over the precipice and
looked down. “I thought you would go over
before I got there.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We must look after Dabney Mills,” Nancy
reminded him suddenly. “Suppose he had
been killed!”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If he had it would be by no fault of his,”
Olaf muttered as he helped her to her feet
and walked with her to where the reporter was
sitting up, looking about him with a dazed expression.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You were mighty slow coming,” he said
morosely to Olaf. “That brute could have
knocked us into kingdom come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was feeling about vaguely, first in his
pockets, then among the weeds and stones
about him. A great blue bruise was spreading
slowly over his face and neck.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have you lost something?” Nancy inquired.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Just my note-book. I—I wanted to put
something down in it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He seemed still to be somewhat stunned,
but he got up and went with them down the
hill. For some time he was silent, an unusual
condition for him, but before they were halfway
home he began to talk again, evidently
composing a proper account of his adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A very dangerous, vicious animal!” he observed.
“It was quite touch and go for a
time, a very narrow escape! Of course, if I
had been carrying any sort of weapon—”
Nancy interrupted with an exclamation, and
Olaf with a covert chuckle. She was about
to declare very frankly that if Olaf had been
unarmed and Dabney possessed of the milk-bucket,
the affair would not have been very
different. Olaf, however, dropped behind and
spoke to her in an undertone:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Please let him go on. He will talk himself
into believing he was quite a hero, and I
want to hear him do it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Aunt Anna was given a very mild account
of the affair when they reached home, with
little emphasis on the danger and a great deal
on how absurd the bear had looked. Yet her
eyes fell upon the deep scratches on Nancy’s
arm and her torn sleeve, and then turned to
Olaf with a look that made him suddenly glow
with embarrassment and pride, but also made
him bid them a panic-stricken good night.
When Aunt Anna’s glance traveled to Dabney
Mills who was beginning to relate his version
of the story quite fluently, he paused,
stammered, and declared that he, too, must be
going. There was no one present who pressed
him to stay.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I will have to give this to Hester for her
chickens,” said Nancy, surveying the wreck of
her cake ruefully, just before she went to bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The girls had promised their aunt that they
would not talk a great deal before they went
to sleep, but they found it difficult to keep
their word. Besides discussing the bear adventure
they had also to talk over Dr. Minturn’s
advice to Beatrice given that morning
and heard by Nancy now for the first time.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He said,” quoted Beatrice, “‘that we
must not hurry a man who has been hurt to
his very soul.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think the doctor was right,” the younger
girl observed thoughtfully. “John Herrick—I
can’t seem to call him anything else—must
be just like Aunt Anna, with just such a will
as hers. And the more he loved his family
the more it must have hurt him to believe that
they doubted his honor.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But suppose he never comes back to us,”
said Beatrice. “Must we sit by and do nothing?
He knew who we were from the first
day we came here, but he has never made a
sign.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Although they had put out the light, the
glowing hands of Beatrice’s wrist-watch reminded
her of her promise. Nancy accordingly
scurried into her own room to bed, and
presumably dropped asleep as quickly as did
Beatrice, who could hardly even remember laying
her head upon the pillow.</p>

<p class='c004'>It must have been several hours later that
Beatrice awoke. She had slept so soundly
that all her weariness was gone and the faintest
of sounds outside had broken through the
thin fabric of her dreams. She sat up, and
turned to the window close beside her bed, to
peer out and to listen.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was moonlight again—a very clear night
and so quiet that the big pine-trees stood as
immovable as though they were a painted forest
on the drop curtain of a theater. The
white flood of light set into sharp relief the
square frame of the window. Beatrice, looking
at the ruffled white curtains, the twin pots
of berries on the sill, and the row of books below,
thought how quaintly cozy and homelike
it looked in contrast to that ghostly wilderness
outside. Then, as she leaned against the
frame to look out, she drew a deep breath of
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Very evidently Aunt Anna had been unable
to sleep and was sitting, wrapped in her big
cloak, reading at the window just below, as
was often her custom. A square of light on
the ground below, and a shadow that moved a
little now and then, as though for the turning
of a page, made it plain that this was so. And
opposite the window, in a clearing among the
pines, some one was walking to and fro. It
was John Herrick, with the moonlight on his
fair hair and flooding the ground about him
like a pool of still water. Somewhere in the
dark behind him his horse was tied, for Beatrice,
when she listened, could hear now and
then the faint stamping of an impatient foot
or the jingle of the bit.</p>

<p class='c004'>If Aunt Anna heard the sounds, she did not
distinguish them from the ordinary noises of
the night, nor, with the lighted lamp beside
her, could she see clearly anything that lay in
the forest beyond. But Beatrice could guess,
as surely as though she stood in the moonlight
beside John Herrick, just how distinct before
his eyes was the lighted window with his sister
sitting beside it. She could imagine, even,
just what that picture must mean to him, the
glowing, shaded lamp, the cushioned chair,
the quiet beauty of Aunt Anna’s profile.
How they must all stand for home and familiar
things, for the unswerving affection of
those of his own blood. He must know,
surely, why his sister had come there, what
she was waiting for as she sat, unconscious and
serene, beside the window. He had only to
lift his voice ever so little above the whispers
of the forest; he had only to speak her name
and the long spell would be broken. Beatrice
held her breath to listen. There was no sound.</p>

<div id='i178'  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus-178.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>He had only to lift his voice and the long spell would be broken</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>He stood, staring up at the window for a
long, long time; then turned upon his heel at
last. Beatrice could actually hear the harsh
grating of his heavy boot upon a stone as he
did so. She heard the jingling of the curb as
he loosed his horse; she heard the creak of the
stirrup leather and the scramble of iron-shod
feet as he swung into the saddle and was off.
There was no hesitation or stopping to look
back; it was as though he had come to a final
decision. Beatrice felt that there was something
very ominous, something dismaying in
the steadily diminishing thud, thud, of the
hoof-beats, as horse and rider drew away into
the darkness. With a long sigh she turned,
shivering, from the window and buried her
face in the pillow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Christina came up the hill to see them next
day, a radiant Christina who had learned that
she need no longer keep secret from her
friends her joy in Olaf’s return. The promise
of the brilliant moonlight had not been
fulfilled in the morning’s weather, for deluges
of rain were falling, sluicing down the steep
roof, dripping from the trees, and swelling the
stream until the sound of the waterfall filled
the whole house. No amount of rain could
quench the Finnish woman’s happiness, however,
as she stood in the kitchen, her garments
soaked and her face beaming.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It seemed so wrong to keep the good news
from you, when it was really through Miss
Beatrice that Olaf came home. I would
never have dared to ask any one to write to
him in the face of Thorvik’s forbidding it.
Olaf came very early one morning, when
Thorvik happened to be away for the night,
and we went straight up to see John Herrick,
for he was always the best friend my boy had.
He made Olaf promise that he would not show
himself in the village, and I know myself that
it is wise that he should keep away after that
business at Mason’s Bluff, but it is hard for
me to see so little of him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Of her son’s adventure with the bear she
made very light indeed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He did nothing more than he should,” she
declared. “Of course, he might have been
hurt, but there was that dear Miss Nancy;
think what might have come to her!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her presence in the kitchen was very welcome,
for Nancy’s arm was too stiff to be of
much service, and Beatrice admitted frankly
that as cook she was a sorry substitute.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Willing but awkward, I would describe
myself if I were advertising for a situation,”
she told them. “Nancy has a special talent
for cooking, but I have a genius for breaking
dishes and scalding myself.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Christina, therefore, stayed to cook the dinner
and to bake a second edition of the cake
upon which misfortune had fallen yesterday.
Olaf came across the hill through the rain and
sat for long in the kitchen with his mother,
making her the most peaceful and uninterrupted
visit that had been possible since his return.
Nancy, going in and out on various errands,
heard snatches of tales of the high seas,
of whales and hurricanes, of hot foreign ports
baking in the tropical sun, of winds that cut
you like a knife as you slid across the slippery
decks with great waves washing over you, of
the longing for the land and home, and also—Olaf
came to it slowly—of the restless desire
that grows and grows, of the sailor on leave
to be at sea again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Ah, but you wouldn’t go just yet!” cried
Christina in alarm.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, not just yet. John Herrick has been
so kind to me that I feel like standing by him
in—in something that he has on hand just
now.” But Olaf leaned back in his chair and
looked out through the blurred windows as
though he were already impatient to be off.</p>

<p class='c004'>They were an oddly assorted pair, he so
tall, straight, and American, she, despite her
ordinary clothes and her careful English, so
foreign still. Beatrice thought so, as she
came into the kitchen in the late afternoon,
and found them both making preparations to
depart. The day had been a long and heavy
one to her. Her mind was full of what she
had seen the night before, although she had
not yet had time to discuss it in private with
Nancy. She longed to ride over to the Herricks’
house, for what purpose she could not
herself say. The pouring rain, however,
made such an expedition so unreasonable that
she could not, in the whole course of the day,
think of an excuse urgent enough to explain
her going.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish you were not going to be so wet,”
she said to Christina. “You will be soaked
again before you get home.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is not raining so much now,” Olaf observed,
reaching for his cap that lay on the
window-sill, “it will soon—”</p>

<p class='c004'>He interrupted himself suddenly and turned
round to them with a delighted grin. He
spoke softly and jerked his head toward the
window where, to Beatrice’s astonishment, she
saw dimly through the wet pane that a face
was peering in. The close-set eyes and ungainly
nose showed that it was Dabney Mills.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never knew before just what the word
eavesdropper meant,” said Olaf. “Think how
the water must be pouring off the roof and
running down that fellow’s neck!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Seeing that he had been observed, Dabney
came to the door and a moment later stood, a
bedraggled and dejected figure, just inside
the threshold.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was looking in to see if there was any
one at home,” he tried to explain, while Olaf
supplemented:</p>

<p class='c004'>“On such a fine day he was afraid you might
all be out.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I went up the mountain to see if I could
get back my note-book,” Dabney went on to
account for his forlorn condition. “I have
been looking for hours, but I couldn’t find it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Maybe the bear put it in her pocket and
went away with it,” suggested Christina flippantly.
“Anyway, it would be soaked to a
pulp by this time.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You needn’t worry, I picked it up last
night when I went back to get the milk-can,”
Olaf said. He brought the familiar leather-covered
book from an inside pocket and held it
out to its owner. A wicked twinkle that he
could not suppress seemed to fill Dabney
Mills with panic-stricken suspicion.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You’ve been reading it,” he cried. “You
had no right. You have been prying into my
private affairs.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The other boy’s face flushed with anger.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It may be I haven’t been brought up a
gentleman like you,” he returned hotly. “But
I wouldn’t be peering and prying into other
people’s business for all that. Whatever
mean secrets you have hid away in that book,
they are there still, safe and sound. All I
did was to write a page at the end. I was
afraid that if you didn’t have an account of
that bear business at once, you might forget
just how it happened.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Dabney snatched the book and nervously
turned to the last page. Beatrice was so close
that she could not help seeing that it was
covered with Olaf’s square schoolboy writing.
The last sentence caught her eye, giving a clue
to the rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Even though our hero took the precaution
of getting behind the lady who was with him,
he did not escape entirely unharmed.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Dabney thrust the book into his pocket and
shot Olaf a glance of wicked rage.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am very much obliged to you,” he said.
“You shall hear of my gratitude later. I
know more about you than you think, young
man.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He went out into the rain, slamming the
door behind him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER X <br /> DABNEY’S CLUE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was still raining next morning, which
was, as Aunt Anna said, “a merciful providence,
considering how much mending there
is to do, and how little we stay indoors to do
it on a bright day.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They sat around the fire talking and sewing
busily, for it was true that much had been
neglected in the enjoyment of other things.
Beatrice, the least enthusiastic seamstress of
the three, was the one whose wardrobe needed
the most repair, since her scrambles over the
mountains had wrought more ruin than she
had realized. If Aunt Anna had not mended
the rent in her riding skirt and Nancy had not
sewed up the rip in her sheepskin coat, she
would never have come to the end.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I seem to have strewed the whole State of
Montana over with buttons,” she declared
with a sigh, “but, oh, how much I have seen
while I have been doing it! If it is still raining
to-morrow, I think Buck will kick out the
side of his stall, he is so impatient to be off
again, and so am I.”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a promise of clearing at sunset,
for the clouds began to lift, and patches of
blue sky showed to the westward, a hopeful
sign for the morrow. The peak of Gray
Cloud Mountain, visible from their doorstep,
loomed through the mist that had shrouded it
from view and before dark showed its towering
outline, clear-cut against the clouds. And
never, never, so Beatrice and Nancy thought,
had they seen a more glorious day than the
morrow turned out to be. With the whole
world washed clean, with the dripping water
dried up in an hour by the all-conquering sunshine,
it seemed that nothing could be more
perfect.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before they had finished breakfast, there
was a loud trampling of hoofs outside, announcing
a cavalcade—Hester Herrick on her
pinto pony, Dr. Minturn with her, and Olaf
riding behind leading a packhorse.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is the day of all days for a picnic,”
Hester announced. “All the time you have
been here, we have talked of going to Eagle
Rock, and you promised to come with me the
first day I could arrange it. Christina will
spend the day with Miss Deems, this horse
that Olaf is on will do for Nancy to ride; and
everything we could possibly need is packed
on old Martha here. Dr. Minturn rode by
our house this morning, and thought he would
come over with me; though he is in a hurry
to get to the village. He will come back this
evening after we have got home to make your
aunt a real, proper visit. Do say you will
come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Her eagerness and the inviting beauty of
the day were not to be denied, so that in a
moment Nancy and Beatrice were running
to and fro in hasty preparation.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Bring warm coats and your swimming
suits and hurry,” Hester directed. “Olaf will
saddle Buck while you are getting ready.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was well that Olaf was there to deal with
Beatrice’s pony, for with the gathered energy
of two days’ vacation, Buck went through all
the tricks in his repertoire during the cinching
of the saddle. He was off down the trail like
an arrow the moment his mistress was in the
saddle, leaving the others trailing far behind.
They came together soon, however, and
climbed merrily upward, looking back at the
valley mapped out below them and at the bare,
brown slopes of the range opposite. They
looked so near in the clear air that Beatrice
shouted, “to see if there would be an echo.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Hardly,” commented Hester, “for they
are twenty miles away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice tried many times, as they went
along, to think of some question to put to
Hester that might bring forth information
about John Herrick, but no matter how often
she led up to it, she was never able to think
what to say. She had told Nancy of that
strange scene in the moonlight, and she was
afraid now of her sister’s blunt frankness,
should the talk touch upon that matter of which
both their minds were so full. In the end,
therefore, she said nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>They reached Eagle Rock well before noon,
unsaddled their horses, removed the generous
bundles of lunch from the back of the willing
pack-pony, and turned all four out to graze.
Above them rose abruptly a huge gray mass
of granite, set in the midst of a smooth slope
of grass and scrubby trees. A clear stream
swept in a curve below the foot of the rock,
spread to a broad pool, and then ran babbling
out of sight among the trees. Hester, who
was, in her own sphere, a capable and self-reliant
young person, showed them how to
hobble the horses lest they stray too far, how
to build a fireplace of stones with its back to
the wind, and then brought out her fishing
tackle and set about teaching the two girls
how to catch rainbow trout.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice succeeded very badly, displaying
a great talent for tangling her hook in the
bushes when she tried to learn to cast. She
laid down her rod after a little, stretched herself
upon her back on the warm grass, and
fell to watching the fleet of towering white
clouds that went drifting overhead. One of
them, which looked even more than the others
like a tall vessel with curved and shining sails,
had come to grief on the jagged shoulder of
Gray Cloud Mountain and hung there, beating
itself to pieces, growing thinner and thinner
as it spread out in long wreaths across
the glowing blue sky. Some of Beatrice’s
cares and worries seemed to be fading from
her mind in much the same way, blown afar
by the brisk, warm gusts of wind.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe everything will come out right
after all,” she thought, “and I shall know,
when the time comes, what I ought to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She got up at last and went to join the
others, who greeted her with reproaches for
having made so little effort to catch any fish.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy, more patient and painstaking, had
come into better fortune. She had learned
to cast, after a fashion, and had managed to
dangle her gay-colored fly in the water at the
edge of a riffle just as Hester had instructed
her. Then came the first tug at her line, a
magic quiver which seemed to send an electric
shock of excitement all up her arm. In that
second she became a fisherman.</p>

<p class='c004'>They landed twelve trout between them,
although Hester’s share was by far the greater,
and they ate all twelve for the lunch that they
spread on a flat, sun-warmed shelf of Eagle
Rock. Such a feast as it was, with sizzling
fried bacon, toasted cheese sandwiches, hot
cocoa, and the trout cooked to a turn by Hester.
Afterward they sat and talked for a
very long time, talked of everything and of
nothing, until Hester jumped up and said
there was only just time for a swim before
going home.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I did not know,” said Nancy a little doubtfully,
“that swimming was one of the usual
sports in the Rocky Mountains.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Most of the water is too cold to be pleasant,”
replied Hester, “but this pool is warm
enough. It is the only one I know of. Roddy
found it long ago, and taught me to swim
here. He says perhaps it was beavers that
helped to dam it and went away years before
we discovered it. The stream is fed by melted
snow, like all the others, but it runs very shallow
for miles above here, out in the open
where the sun can warm it. By mid-afternoon,
like this, it is not cold at all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She donned her bathing suit and dropped
into the water with a splash. After a moment
of doubt and hesitation, her two friends followed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh!” cried Beatrice and “Oh,” echoed
Nancy, “I did not know it would be like this!”</p>

<p class='c004'>A person who has never bathed in the clear,
rock pools of the high mountainsides cannot
know what real exhilaration is. The two
girls caught their breath with delight and wonder,
with a pleasure that was quite indescribable.
To plunge into the crystal-blue water,
to know that it has poured down from the
vast glaciers and great, empty snow-fields
where no human foot ever comes, to feel all
the tingling freshness of the water without its
deadly cold—there are few things like it in
the world. The girls laughed and splashed
and swam and floated until Hester warned
them that it was not wise to stay in too long,
and they came out reluctantly to dry themselves
in the sun.</p>

<p class='c004'>They scrambled almost to the top of Eagle
Rock, found a shelf that was sheltered from
the wind, and sat down in a row, swinging
their feet over the void beneath and looking
out over the long ranges of hills and mountains,
brown, russet, red, and chrome-yellow,
fading to the blue peaks in the far distance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“That must be a mountain sheep, that dot
moving there opposite us,” Hester observed.
“And you can see Gray Cloud Pass over beyond
the shoulder of this nearest hill. The
tuft of green above is that stretch of woods
growing around the lake, but see how bare the
slope is where it goes up beyond—nothing but
solid rock and overhanging cliffs to the very
top. There is a little trail that picks its way
back and forth over the face of the mountain;
it is called Dead Man’s Mile, there is so much
danger, just there, from unsteady footing and
rocks falling from above.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice remembered how she had come to
grief even on the lower, easier slope, and shuddered
at the thought of the difficulties higher
up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yet I should like to climb it,” she thought.
The very impossibility of the idea made it seem
all the more inviting.</p>

<p class='c004'>They sat there even after they were dry,
but finally Hester, with a sigh, declared they
must go.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It has been such a pleasant day,” she said,
“I hate to have it end. We—we aren’t very
happy at home, just now, Roddy and I.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“What!” exclaimed Nancy. “What can be
the matter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t know,” Hester answered hopelessly.
“I really brought you here so that we could
talk about it, but it has been so hard to speak
that I haven’t said anything, and now it is
time to go home. Long ago Roddy used to
be like this sometimes. He would look worried
and troubled for days and at last would
go off, camping in the hills, hunting and fishing
and thinking things out, and he would
come home quite cheerful again. That was
long, long past; I had almost forgotten it,
but now it has all come back again. He is
miserable and restless, and troubled over something
I can’t understand. Just last night he
asked me the strangest thing. He wanted to
know if I could be happy in some other place
if he decided not to live here any longer. And
I had thought he loved Gray Cloud Mountain
best of any place in the world!”</p>

<p class='c004'>If John Herrick did not tell her his secret,
they had no right to do so. Such was the unspoken
message that passed between the sisters
as Nancy tried to offer comfort, with very little
success.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I suppose there is no use in talking of it,”
said little Hester at last with a sigh. “Things
may be better some time. Well, we must be
going home. Climb down, and I will show
you how to throw the diamond hitch on a packhorse.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The ride home was less hilarious than their
setting out had been, and Beatrice and Nancy
went up the path to the cabin with no very
light hearts. In the evening, however, they
were made happy again by a visit from Dr.
Minturn and his very good report of Aunt
Anna.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I could not ask for anything better,” he
declared, fully as delighted as were they. The
beaming warmth of his smile seemed to light
the whole room.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have something to propose,” he went on.
“Nancy here has come to be more of a rider
than she was when I visited you before, and I
have been wondering if she would go over the
pass with me to-morrow and spend a few days
with Miriam. Mrs. Minturn has asked me
over and over again if she couldn’t learn to
know both the girls, and this is a good chance.
Beatrice can ride over to come back with her,
since she should not go over the trail alone.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was difficult to persuade Nancy to leave
her housekeeping, but arguments prevailed at
last and she set off next morning, with many
last messages and instructions to Beatrice, and
with a great deal of pleasure and excitement
shining in her eyes. John Herrick had sent
over the same horse she had ridden yesterday,
a gentle creature on which she was more comfortable
than when mounted upon the gay
spirited Buck. Beatrice was to follow in
three days to come back with her. The house
seemed very empty without her busy presence,
and Olaf, when he came with the milk, declared
that nothing was the same at all with
Miss Nancy gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And things aren’t very cheerful where I
live, either,” he said. “Miss Hester has been
crying, and that Dabney Mills has been hanging
around the place. He brings no good with
him, whatever he comes for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice was not inclined to take the amateur
detective very seriously; but, she was concerned
indeed to hear that Hester was still
unhappy. She was desirous of riding over to
see her, but her unpractised skill as a housewife
made it difficult for her to find a spare
moment. Most of the next day passed without
her having time for visiting, but when
evening came she was ordered by Aunt Anna
to go out for a little, since she had toiled in
the house all day. As there was not time
enough for a ride, she strolled down the path
under the pines and stood at the bars of the
gate, watching the slow tide of shadows creep
up the hillsides opposite. For so long a time
did she stand there that when two figures came
down the hill from the direction of John Herrick’s
house it was too dark to see who they
were, and they were only to be recognized by
their voices. The loudness of their speech indicated
that neither Olaf nor Dabney Mills
was in a friendly mood.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We give you warning,” Olaf was saying,
“that you are not to come on John Herrick’s
place again. You are to ask no more questions
of anybody. You are to put that note-book
in your pocket and shut your mouth and get
out. If you show yourself here again, you will
get something that will make what you took
from the bear seem like a love-pat.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You warn me? Who are you, giving orders?”
Dabney Mills thrust his face forward
sharply and spoke almost into the other’s.
“Who <i>are</i> you? That’s what I’m asking?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Olaf hesitated, then swung about without replying
and strode off up the hill.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Imposter!” cried Dabney after him.
“Liar!” He caught sight suddenly of Beatrice
beside the gate and changed his manner
quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Good evening,” he said pleasantly, “might
I ask——”</p>

<p class='c004'>He had glanced upward toward Olaf, disappearing
in the dusk, so that Beatrice guessed
the question concerned him, and interrupted.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no use in your asking me anything,”
she said. “We are all very tired of
your questions, and think you have no right to
ask them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I don’t want to inquire about him,”
returned Dabney, indicating Olaf with a jerk
of his thumb. “I know who he is all right—Christina’s
boy that went off to sea, and that
has such a warm welcome waiting for him in
Ely. I found out who he was the day the
bear knocked me out. I came to and saw him
hanging over that precipice and I knew, all
in a minute, that only a sailor could have the
head to do such a thing. I had my suspicions
before, and I only needed that to make
me sure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“If you tell about him in the village,” said
Beatrice, growing rather indiscreet in the
defense of Olaf, “he may have something
to tell about you and my sister and the
bear.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I don’t care to talk very much about
him for a while,” Dabney declared hastily.
“It’s another person I have my eye on—bigger
game than Olaf Jensen. I’m trying to find
out who took that money and broke up the
work down in Ely. And I’ve about found
out, too.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He gave her a long meaning look and turned
away.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Wait!” cried Beatrice. “You don’t mean
that you think Olaf——” She could not go
on.</p>

<p class='c004'>“What’s he hanging around here for, afraid
to show himself and afraid to go away? Oh,
he’s in it all right; he may even have done the
actual stealing, but not just for himself.
There’s some one else involved—some one
higher up. I’ll soon be able to tell who took
the company’s money and wrecked the whole
project.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who?” the question broke from Beatrice in
a cry of anger, but she felt also a sickening
dread and foreboding of what his answer
would be.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, I’m not telling—yet,” he replied, quite
restored to his usual impudent calm. “He’s a
fellow that it will be hard to prove anything
against. Most people, even the laborers, talk
pretty well of him, and nobody knows anything
to his discredit. Nobody knows very
much about him at all, as far as I can make
out. But I’ve got my proofs all lined up and
with just a little more——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Who?” cried Beatrice desperately again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dabney Mills merely jerked his thumb toward
where the lights of John Herrick’s house
were shining among the trees. Even as they
looked up, the door opened, showing, silhouetted
against the light within, Hester and John
Herrick standing on the threshold. He
turned as though to bid her good-by, then
strode down the steps without looking back.
She stood, however, with the door still open
and the light streaming out, so that they could
see him mount his horse and ride away up the
trail into the mountains.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” said Dabney, “that’s the one.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But Beatrice did not answer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XI <br /> OVER THE PASS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Through all the night following Dabney Mills’
veiled accusation of John
Herrick, Beatrice slept very little. A tireless
procession of thoughts went trooping through
her weary mind: Aunt Anna’s story of her
brother, that strange vision of John Herrick
walking back and forth in the moonlight, the
sight of his departure. What did all these
things mean in the end? Perhaps John Herrick
had gone away forever, perhaps Dabney
Mills had real proofs of—no, no that could
not be! Come what might, she would never
believe anything against John Herrick. It
was a help, at least, to think that next day she
was to go over the pass to bring Nancy back,
and that she could ask the advice of Dr. Minturn.
He alone could be trusted with knowledge
of both sides of the affair; he would give
her counsel from a wise and friendly heart.
The comfort of this thought brought her sleep
at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>As early as she could make ready, she set
off next morning. She stopped for a minute
at the door of the Herrick’s house, hoping
to hear that she had been mistaken in her
understanding of what she had seen. But no,
Hester met her at the door with heavy eyes and
told her that John Herrick had gone away very
suddenly, “soon after that horrid boy, Dabney
Mills, had been here. He took his tent and
quite a supply of food. He may have been
planning to camp several days, but he didn’t
tell me where or why. He just said, ‘so-long
Hester; better luck by and by,’ and galloped
away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Much disheartened, Beatrice turned her
horse’s head to the trail and began to mount
steadily the zigzag path that led to Gray
Cloud Pass. The way had grown familiar
now, so that instead of looking out at the wide
panorama of mountains or gazing ahead to
search out the trail, she was free to observe
smaller things: a hollow tree with an owl’s
nest in it from which a red-brown head with inquisitive
round eyes was thrust to watch her
pass; the busy little gophers that popped in
and out of their holes at her approach, consumed
by both curiosity and alarm; the awkward,
unhurried porcupine that crossed the
trail ahead of her and disappeared into the
brush. She knew well that the forest about
her must be alive with tiny, bright eyes and
sharp, peering little faces, but she had neither
time nor patience to watch for them. So full
was she of surging hopes and desires, her
one idea was to push forward. To seek advice,
find out what was the best thing to do,
and then do it—those were the only things that
would bring her peace of mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>The day was not so clear as yesterday had
been. The sun shone with less warmth, even
as noon approached, the hills were dun-color
and the far mountains purple instead of blue.
Beatrice was not weather-wise enough to know
just what such conditions meant, nor could she
have hurried forward more impatiently if she
had. Even the willing Buck finally protested
against the haste she demanded of him and refused
to increase his speed even when she
touched him with the whip.</p>

<p class='c004'>There was a certain level stretch of ground
that she remembered, a nook between two
rocks, with the stream splashing below. She
was determined to reach this spot before
she stopped to eat her lunch, although noon
had passed and she was beginning to be hungry.
She finally came up the last rise of the
steep path, breathless with haste, and did not
observe the curl of blue smoke that was going
up from behind the rocks. Dismounting,
and with Buck’s bridle over her arm, she turned
the corner of the wall of rock to find her picnic
ground occupied. A little fire was burning
between two stones, a string of trout hung before
it, and a slim black mare grazed lazily
beside the mountain wall. The man who
turned to greet her was John Herrick.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her mind had been so full of thoughts of
him that for a moment it seemed impossible to
speak to him naturally. He also stood, surprised
and nonplussed, apparently unable to
utter a word. He took Buck’s bridle from her
at last and, still in silence, loosened the girths,
lifted off the saddle, and let the horse roll
luxuriously on the grass.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have ridden him too hard,” he said
at length, looking at Buck’s wet sides and
wide nostrils. “Not even a mountain-bred
pony can stand such a pace. Why, did you
hurry so? Was there anything the matter?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“N-no,” replied Beatrice doubtfully. She
could not have told him why she had been in
such impatient haste; perhaps she could not
even explain it to herself. Certainly she was
in no hurry to go forward now, but knelt down
by the fire and fell to turning the trout, while
he picketed her horse and spread a blanket
for her to sit on. As she looked up to thank
him she saw that the heavy cloud that had been
visible on his face when she first saw him was
lifted now, making him look his smiling, cheerful
self again. It was as though her chance
coming had done him good.</p>

<p class='c004'>The picnic yesterday had been merry, but
this one, somehow seemed gayer still. They
joked and laughed as they shared in the preparations;
he tried to teach her how to make
flapjacks and laughed at her awkwardness
when she attempted to toss them; she criticized
his method of boiling coffee and made him admit
that hers was better. As they sat eating
he told her tales of past camping adventures;
how he had once crawled into a cavern under a
cliff to take shelter from the rain and had discovered
that it was the home of a most unamiable
mountain lion; how, in his tent, far up on
Gray Cloud Mountain, a grizzly bear cub had
slipped under the canvas and invited itself to
share his bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“And I had to be polite to the pushing,
grunting little beast,” he said, “for its mother
and my rifle were both outside.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After they had finished their lunch they still
sat lazily by the fire, watching the thin smoke
drift far across the depths below them until
it lost itself in the distant blue haze. Beatrice
was leaning against the warm rock while her
companion sat upright, his clear-cut profile
showing against the vast blue sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He looks hardly more than just grown
up, when he talks and laughs like that,” was
her inward reflection. It seemed as though he
had dropped the burden that had been so
heavy all these years, and, in this hour of
friendliness, had gone back to the boyhood he
had cast from him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He was pointing out to her the wide, dry
lands of Broken Bow Valley, which, with irrigation,
were some day to be orchards and
meadows and rich farming land instead of a
broad waste, polka-dotted with sage-brush.
At some length he told of the difficulty in getting
the irrigation project started, of how
long it had taken to form a company and to
get construction under way. But of one thing
he did not speak, of the interruption in the
work, of the threatened strike and the disappearance
of the company’s funds. Beatrice
waited, hoping that he would let fall some explanation,
throw some light on that mystery,
and refute forever the dismaying suspicions
of Dabney Mills. Of that phase of
the matter, however, he said no single
word.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When it is all finished and the valley is
prosperous,” he said, “you must be careful
when sharp traders try to buy your cabin from
you, or make bids for your big pines. You
must not part with them at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I think I could never part with them,” she
assured him. “I did not know how much I
could learn to love the woods and the cabin and
the mountains.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He sat for a little while, looking across to
where the shadows of clouds moved, one by
one, across the dark slopes of the range opposite.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are friendly things, these mountains,”
he observed. “They stand by you when you
are in trouble, somehow, they are so big and
calm and untroubled themselves.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Their friendship and confidence had brought
them so close together that Beatrice felt suddenly
the thrill of a bold impulse. She
cast aside Dr. Minturn’s advice to let John
Herrick make the first move toward reconciliation.
It did not occur to her that the man
beside her might be talking so freely only because
he meant so soon to close his friendship
to her forever. She reflected only on how triumphant
she would be when her management
had brought the whole misunderstanding to a
happy end. Yet she did not dare speak out at
once.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only think,” she began suddenly, “that
you and I might be lunching at—at the Manhattan
together if things had been a little different.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes.” She was greatly encouraged by his
immediate assent. He looked at his gray flannel
shirt and at her patched riding skirt and
went on. “We wouldn’t be dressed just as
we are now, would we? And there would be
music, instead of the sound of a stream, and
a hundred voices talking all at once, instead
of those two magpies chattering in the thicket.
The fat lady at the next table—there always
is one—might be wearing a beaver scarf made
from the jacket of some furry little fellow
that swam in that very pool below us, and
the waiter might tell us that there was an unusual
delicacy to-day—rainbow trout.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She leaned forward, feeling bolder still.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You haven’t forgotten,” she said, “and you
will be coming back to it all some day. We
know who you are. We want so much to have
you belong to us again. Aren’t you coming
back?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He stood up suddenly and faced her. In
that instant she knew that she had done wrong.
The shadow of unforgettable pain swept over
his face and the laughter died in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You know?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c004'>She did not trust herself to speak or even to
look at him. Mutely she nodded keeping her
wide, unseeing eyes on the fire, clenching her
hands, holding her breath and waiting. There
was a long, long pause.</p>

<p class='c004'>He moved at last, strode to the fire and trod
out the flames and the smouldering coals with
his big boots.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is time we were going on,” he said.
“You must reach Dr. Minturn’s before dark
and I have none too much daylight left to
climb my own trail.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Helplessly she stood watching while he
caught the horses and saddled them. The
black one yielded quietly enough, but Buck,
according to his usual habit, filled the whole
rock-walled space with his plunging and rearing,
a small but spirited sample of the Wild
West. He had to yield at last, however and
was led to where his mistress was waiting.
John Herrick’s hat was off and his fair hair
was ruffled by the wind and by his struggles
with the reluctant pony. Beatrice noticed
as never before how like he was to Aunt
Anna. Since she had done so much harm already,
she felt she might make one more effort.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aren’t you coming back?” she questioned
desperately.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No,” he answered, “I am never coming
back.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He swung into the saddle and, with a great
rattling of stones dislodged by the pony’s
hoofs, he was off up the steep trail. It might
have been that he looked back, once, to see a
bright-haired girl hide her face in her arm and
bow her head against the rock, while a white-nosed
pony nuzzled her shoulder in vain effort
to offer comfort. But if John Herrick looked
back he paid no heed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XII <br /> DEAD MAN’S MILE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>It was comfort rather than advice that a
very weary and dispirited Beatrice needed
when at last she arrived at Dr. Minturn’s
house. She greeted the rosy, laughing Nancy
with much enthusiasm, for the sisters had
missed each other sorely; but she was impatient
for the moment when she could talk over their
whole affair with the kindly doctor. After
supper, accordingly, he sat, on the grassy bank
in the moonlight, with a girl on each side of
him, and listened gravely to all that Beatrice,
with occasional additions from Nancy, had to
say. It was not easy for her to confess what
harm she had done by her impulsive and over
confident words, but she told her story bravely
to the end.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no use in the world,” the doctor
commented cheerfully, “in spending time in
vain remorse. We should decide what must
be done now. It may be, the only thing is to
wait.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice drew a deep quivering sigh. It
seemed, in the midst of excitement and the
anxiety to atone, that waiting was the one intolerable
thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I can’t bear to wait,” she burst out at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I have never told you,” Dr. Minturn rejoined
slowly, “of how Miriam and I came to
live here. We used to be in a big city and we
had that same full, restless life that most city
dwellers know. Some people thrive in such
an atmosphere, some can endure it, but it was
destruction to us both. I had more patients
than I could care for, Miriam’s days were
as crowded as mine. We saw each other little
and were always tired when our daily duties
were done. I realized vaguely that such unceasing
toil must kill any man before long, but
the excitement of my growing practice was
something I could not give up. Then Miriam,
one day, asked me some questions; she
knew some one who had such and such symptoms,
who felt this way during the smoky winter
and that way when the air was damp and
the wind was raw. I was in haste and my
verdict was quick. ‘Such a person could not
live a year,’ I declared. And then she told me
the person was herself!”</p>

<p class='c004'>He paused to look down at the quiet house
under the trees, where Miriam’s shadow
showed on one white curtain after another as
she went to and fro about her work. For a
minute he watched as though to assure himself
that the memory of that terrible day was only
a dream.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is something we all have to learn; how
to watch our whole, secure, happy world fall
to pieces before our eyes, and still keep our
minds clear and be able to think what to do.
‘A change of climate,’ my fellow-doctors advised;
‘Quiet, rest, no anxiety’; but they all
shook their heads. We tried place after place,
it would be too long a story to tell how we
drifted here at last. The cottage was only
half its size, then, but it was habitable; the
place seemed good as any; and neither of us
had the heart to go farther. The wrench of
leaving the old life, the weariness of wandering
from place to place had all done harm; and the
good effect of the change had not yet come.
Miriam was always cheerful, always hopeful,
but I watched her grow thinner and weaker
every day. I stood by, helpless. There was
nothing to do but wait, though it seemed that
waiting must drive me mad.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice nodded understandingly. Waiting—how
she hated it! It seemed as though there
must always be something to do other than to
wait; but it was likely to be the wrong thing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There was one morning when I had been
watching beside her bed all night, thinking, as
she slept, how pinched and thin and shadowy
she had grown. We were young then, if you
can think of us as that, young like your Aunt
Anna and John Herrick, with years to dream
of still before us. And that night it seemed
as though it all was coming to an end. I
can remember how the dawn came in at the
windows and how Miriam opened her eyes to
look up at me and smile. I believe she was
thinking that she would rather die here in the
clean, empty quiet than in that roaring, smoke-filled
town that we called home.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But it was no place of peace for me. I
called the nurse and flung myself out of the
house; I tramped away up the mountain,
crushing the roses and forget-me-nots under
foot with a savage pleasure that I can still recall.
I stood on the highest ridge at last,
looked out over the valley and the dark hills
with their summits bathed in sunshine, at the
winding silver thread of the river, and I held
up my arms and opened my lips to curse them
all.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The words I meant to say were never
spoken. I heard a footstep on the trail behind
me and, as I looked around, a man passed
by me and went down the mountain. He was
old, far older than I am now, his face was so
weather-beaten, his long hair so grizzled, and
his back so bent that he might have passed for
Father Time himself. He said no word, but
he gave me one look that seemed to read every
thought within me, a glance of complete and
utter scorn. Some old prospector he was, a
man who had spent his life trudging over the
barren hillsides, looking for new mines, disappointed
a thousand times, seeking fortune and
never finding it. Others who followed him
had prospered by his discoveries, had found
the riches that he could not keep; for the man
who prospects is seldom the man who gathers
wealth. He gathers other things, however;
forbearance, understandings, and a strange,
deep patience, born of lonely valleys, endless
trails, and wide starry skies. It was no wonder he
scorned me and my pitiful little anger
with the mountains he called his.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I never saw him again. He stepped into
my life and out of it again, and we did not
even exchange a word. Yet I have never forgotten
the lesson his one look taught me. I
went down the hill after a little, and the nurse
met me at the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“‘I thought you would never come,’ she said.
‘I have been thinking for days that there was a
little change, and now I am sure of it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, the broad daylight showed it: the
flame of Miriam’s life was burning a little
brighter; the mountain air was beginning to
do its work at last. In a week she could sit
up; in a month she could walk about; and in a
year she was well.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“And you never went home again?” Nancy
asked, when a pause marked the end of his
tale.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Home was here now, and we had no wish
to go back to a life that had so nearly been the
end of both of us. For a time there was no
doctor in the valley below us here, so I used
to do what I could for the sick people in these
mountains. My place at home was soon filled;
the tasks I had left went on without me. By
and by a younger man moved into this valley
to take the work, so that I was free to try that
experiment that I had long thought of—what
Miriam calls my Christmas-tree Garden. I
have helped again when there were epidemics
in the valley and when our doctor went to war;
but I am always glad to lay the burden down
and come back to my trees. And the point
of all my long story is, my dear, that some
time in the course of our growing up, we must
learn how to wait. To be eager and ardent is
part of being young, but to learn that eagerness
does not bring all things is a truth that
the years bring us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He made a gesture toward the summit of
Gray Cloud Mountain, a black mass against
the twinkling stars.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is learning his lesson, too, that boy up
there, camping in the dark and the silence,
thinking it all out, coming nearer and nearer
to the truth of things at last.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you—oh, do you think that he might
change and come back to us in the end?” cried
Beatrice in eager hope.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I believe so. And when the time comes to
act, you will know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A very sleepy and comforted girl was tucked
into bed by the doctor’s wife—a young person
who thought she could not sleep on account of
her many anxieties, but who was lost in slumber
almost before the door was closed. She
did not even hear the storm of wind and rain
that swept over the cottage in the night, but
awoke in the morning to see the sun shining,
and to hear a camp-robber jay calling so loudly
from the nearest tree that she could sleep no
longer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Your horse is not fit to go back for a day
or two,” Dr. Minturn said at breakfast. “You
pushed him too hard when you climbed the
pass, and you should leave him here to rest. I
will lend you my brown Presto. He is not
such a pony as Buck, I admit, but he will carry
you safely enough. You can come back for
your horse later, or I will send him over the
range as soon as some one passes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The sun was high when she and Nancy set
out together, shining above the pass as they
mounted upward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But there is something the matter with it,”
Beatrice declared to her sister; “there doesn’t
seem to be any warmth in it, somehow.” And
she shivered a little.</p>

<p class='c004'>An unusual haze seemed to hang like a blanket
between them and the sun, and the air held
a strange chill. Even when wrapped in their
warm coats, the two girls felt cold as they
climbed to the summit of the pass and began
the descent on the other side. Beatrice said
very little, so busy was her mind with many
difficult problems. Must she tell Aunt Anna
what had happened, and let her know that all
hopes of meeting her brother were at an end?
Would John Herrick’s house soon be closed,
and would Hester have to leave them too?</p>

<p class='c004'>Would it be of any use—Good heavens!
what was that lying beside the trail? Something
huge, dark, and unwieldy was stretched
out among the bushes: it was a black horse, apparently
dead. They both knew those white
feet and the brand on the flank. It was John
Herrick’s black mare, Dolly.</p>

<p class='c004'>They dismounted, while the poor creature
opened its eyes and managed to raise its head.
A horse that is so injured that it cannot get
up when a person comes near is sorely hurt
indeed. That much Beatrice knew, yet was
powerless to discover what was the matter.
By some intuition Nancy guessed one thing,
at least, that was needed, for she ran to the
stream, filled her felt hat with water, and
brought it back, spilling and dripping, but with
enough left for the poor animal to drink gratefully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish you could speak,” Beatrice said
helplessly, as the mare laid her head down
again. Presto nudged her inquiringly with
his nose, but she did not move.</p>

<p class='c004'>They observed as they stood looking at her,
that the bridle was half torn off—that the
big saddle, with broken cantle, was twisted all
to one side by the pony’s fall. On the face of
the mountain wall above them they could trace
Dolly’s disastrous course in trampled bushes,
weeds torn up by the roots, gouges in the rocky
soil where she had slid and rolled and struggled
to regain her footing. But look where
they might, they could see no sign of John
Herrick.</p>

<p class='c004'>“When the time comes to act, you will know
what to do.”</p>

<p class='c004'>So Dr. Minturn had said, and he had been
right. Beatrice knew well that now was the
moment for action, not waiting; and she felt
her mind surprisingly calm and cool. They
must follow the spidery line of trail that zig-zagged
back and forth over the precipitous
mountain-side, and find the spot, high above,
from which the black mare had fallen.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You wait here, Nancy,” she ordered, but
she heard the other horse’s hoofs pattering behind
her even as she turned. It was useless
to try to make Nancy stay behind. What was
it Hester had said that way was called—that
tiny path that crawled out upon the smooth
face of the rock wall? It was Dead Man’s
Mile.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were moments when the brown pony
slipped, moments when the vast depths below
made both the girls so giddy that they were
forced to shut their eyes. A big stone rolled
under Presto’s foot and he drew back only just
in time to keep from plunging after it. Beatrice
tried not to watch it, but she could not
keep her eyes away as it slid and bounded in
longer and longer leaps until finally it disappeared
into the woods below.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you safe, Nancy?” she called. She
did not dare look back.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” came the reply, rather unsteadily,
from Nancy close behind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Up and up they went. It seemed as though
they would remember for all their lives every
treacherous inch of that trail along which they
crawled as a fly crawls crookedly up a window-pane,
and yet that they would never be able to
find their way down again. Up and up—and
there suddenly was John Herrick, lying on a
narrow shelf of rock just below them, his white
face turned upward to the sky, and the stones
and tufts of grass about him stained with blood.
Just ahead, at the turn of the trail, they could
see his little tent, his various belongings heaped
together, and the aimless, drifting smoke of
his still smoldering camp fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before Nancy could even cry out, Beatrice
was down from her horse, down from the trail,
and was kneeling beside him. A gash across
the forehead was his most evident injury, but
that could not account for all this blood. No,
here on the under side of his arm, where the
sleeve of his coat was torn away, this was the
deeper wound from which had poured forth
that crimson deluge that had soaked his clothes
and stained the ground under him. Thanks to
instructions that she had received long before,
she knew what to do. But could she be quick
enough? Might she not be too late? As she
twisted her handkerchief, she tried to remember
just what she had been told, where the knot
was to come, just which spot was the proper
one for the pressure.</p>

<p class='c004'>Those first-aid lectures—it was only because
every one else was going to them that she had
attended at all. And she was rather bored by
the time she had reached the third one, and
prone to let her mind wander. With maddening
clearness, she could recollect how she had
looked out of the window, glanced at one girl’s
hair-ribbon, decided she would have a dress
like the one in front of her, and with only
half her mind had listened to what the lecturer
was saying. And now John Herrick’s chance
of life was hanging on her memory! Nancy
was standing beside her, helpless, horrified, unable
to be of use until Beatrice should tell
her how. She remembered now: she had found
the artery where the pulse still beat feebly; she
had arranged the pad to press against the
bone; she was telling Nancy how to help her
twist the bandage tight.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slowly the trickle of blood lessened, came
forth, at last, one drop at a time, and finally
ceased altogether. It seemed a long, long wait
before John Herrick opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Was Dolly killed?” he asked first, and then,
after a while, “How do you come to be here?
Surely you never climbed that trail, you girls,
alone?”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a grisly nightmare, their attempt to
get him up to the level bench of ground where
he had pitched his camp, but they managed it at
last. One effort they made to lift him into
Presto’s saddle, but it was attended with so
little success and such evident agony, that they
gave it up.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There’s something broken—besides the
cuts in my arm,” John Herrick muttered, and
lapsed into unconsciousness as they managed
to drag him under the shelter of his tent.
They propped up his injured arm on a roll of
blankets, replenished the fire, and sat down on
each side of him to wait until he should rouse
himself again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although it was high noon the sky was
strangely dark, and even under the sheltering
wall of the tent the air was growing very cold.
Heavy masses of cloud were sailing across
the overcast sky, and the mountains were taking
on a strange, somber color that was so unfamiliar
as to be terrifying.</p>

<p class='c004'>Looking down, they saw that John Herrick
had opened his eyes again and was staring up
at them without moving. In answer to the
unspoken question in Beatrice’s eyes, he began
to explain very slowly, with long pauses for
rest.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I fell, very early in the morning, before
the dawn, just as the storm was going by.
I was riding recklessly in the dark. Poor
Dolly knew we were in danger and hung back,
but I urged her on. She slipped and I was
flung clear, but I could not move. I could
hear her scrambling and rolling and falling
farther and farther below me, but I could not
even turn my head. You say she was really
still alive?”</p>

<p class='c004'>He was quiet for a long time after this effort,
but at last spoke again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You have made me very comfortable,” he
said. “You have done everything possible.
Now it is time for you to go.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go?” echoed Nancy. “Why must we go?”</p>

<p class='c004'>His eyes were looking beyond her at the
threatening sky, and that ominous, deeping
color of the range opposite. Only one peak,
the highest, stood shining above the others, still
bathed in fitful sunshine; but in a moment the
enveloping shadow had crawled up the slope
and quenched its brilliance at last.</p>

<p class='c004'>John Herrick spoke again, more insistently.</p>

<p class='c004'>“At the very best it makes me shudder to
have you two go down that trail alone, and
you must do it while the light is good and there
is nothing to hurry you.” He struggled to
raise himself on his elbow and added sharply,
“You are not to delay. You can send some
one back to find me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy got up obediently and went to stand
before the tent. The two horses were lingering
near the fire: she caught their bridles and
waited. It was her elder sister who must decide
what they were to do.</p>

<p class='c004'>A long bank of cloud, seething, boiling, dark
below but white at its upper edge, like surf
breaking on a reef, was rolling over the summit
of the rugged height opposite. The slow
roar of the rising wind could be heard stirring
the tree-tops in the forest below. Seeing Beatrice
hesitate at the door of the tent, John Herrick
broke forth with the desperate truth.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is snow coming. An hour of it
will make the trail impassable for you. It
will be cold as midwinter before night, and
dark long before then. There is not a minute
for you to lose. Beatrice, my dear, my dear,
what does anything matter if harm comes to
you and your sister? Go! Go!”</p>

<p class='c004'>A breath of wind touched Beatrice for a
second and was gone, yet its icy chill cut her
to the very bone. Through the comparative
warmth of the air about them it had appeared
and vanished like the dread ghost of that bitter
cold, reigning up yonder where the snows never
melted and the ice-fields clung to the mountain-side
the whole year through. Nancy shivered,
and the brown horse, trembling too,
shouldered close to her. But Beatrice, in the
door of the tent, turned suddenly to regard
John Herrick with steady eyes, with a look as
fixed and determined as his very own.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We are not going to leave you,” she said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XIII <br /> “OLD FRIENDS AND OLD TIMES”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>A riderless brown pony, very cautious
and very wise, stepping carefully
from ledge to ledge, testing his footing and
picking his way with the greatest of skill, was
the messenger upon whom depended all hope
of safety for Beatrice, Nancy, and John Herrick.
Tucked under his stirrup leather was a
note that Beatrice had scrawled hastily on the
scrap of paper that had wrapped their sandwiches.
It was addressed to Dr. Minturn and
told where they were and how desperate was
their need. She had knotted the bridle reins
on Presto’s neck, turned up the stirrups over
the saddle, given him a slap on the flank and
told him to “go home.” Every well-trained
Western horse knows that order, and will find
his way over the steepest trails back to his own
stable, nor will he allow himself to be stopped
or molested on the way.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is lucky we had Presto,” Beatrice said to
her sister. “Buck or your horse would have
taken twice as long to get home, and Hester
and Aunt Anna would be so frightened, though
Olaf would have known what to do. As it is,
they won’t worry, for I said I might stay another
day. I wonder how soon help can
come.”</p>

<p class='c004'>John Herrick, lying very still among the
blankets, made no comment. They began to
realize that he had summoned all his strength
to pretend he was not much hurt and to persuade
them to leave him. It was plain that
he was suffering intensely, and was resting before
trying to go on with what he had to say.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Unsaddle Nancy’s pony,” he directed at
last, “and turn him loose. Without his saddle
he will know he is turned out to graze and
will not go home. He will drift down the
mountain and find shelter somewhere in the
timber, for he could not go through the storm
here on the hill.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The sides of the tent flapped and quivered
in the eddies of the wind as the gale began to
blow heavier. Under John Herrick’s direction,
they rolled stones on the edge of the canvas
to keep the blast from creeping under it,
and laid larger logs of wood at the back of
the fire to make a slower, steadier blaze.</p>

<p class='c004'>The smoke of the fire, with most of its heat
also, was tossed and whirled out into the void,
but they were able finally to hang up a spare
tarpaulin to reflect the warmth into the tent.
The site of the camp had been chosen wisely,
being sheltered by a high shoulder of rock,
with a nook between two stones to hold the fire,
and a small stream pouring over a cliff near
by. Yet, even in this corner, there was not
complete protection from the roaring blast
that was beginning to carry the first flakes of
snow. More than once Beatrice saw the injured
man’s eyes turn anxiously toward the
pile of fuel, gathered in abundance for ordinary
purposes, but pitifully small for the need
that had arisen now. She knew that he would
not tell them of the necessity for gathering
more, since to seek fire-wood on that windswept
mountain was a dangerous and difficult
task.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Go into the tent and talk to him, Nancy.
Keep him looking another way,” she whispered
as she fed the blaze. “I am going down the
trail a little way to cut some brush.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Taking up the small ax from where he had
left it beside the fire and turning her coat collar
up to her ears, she slipped away before
her sister could protest.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wind whipped about her the moment
she passed beyond the sheltering rock, buffeting
and blinding her until she thought she
would be flung from the ledge. She had never
felt such piercing cold. It cut through her
coat and made her fingers and feet ache in a
moment. Valiantly she struggled forward,
getting her bearings gradually and peering
this way and that through the driving snow
to find the fuel that was so desperately needed.
Among the tufts of scrubby bushes that clung
here and there to the stony slope, it was difficult
to discover anything dry enough to burn.
Nor was it easy to cut through the tough, fibrous
stems that had clung to the mountain in
defiance of so many storms. As she became
more used to her task, however, she began to
see more and more what she could use; the
brisk exercise warmed her, and the armfuls of
brush that she carried back and heaped up by
the tent began to grow encouragingly high.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Don’t go again,” Nancy begged at last.
“It is getting dark, and you are going farther
and farther away. I know you should not try
it any more.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Only one more trip,” Beatrice returned
blithely. “I won’t leave this upper stretch of
trail, and that is safe enough.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She was beginning to enjoy her task, to feel
a glowing defiance of the wind that pushed and
swayed her; and she was conscious of a warming
pride in that heap of fuel that meant comfort,
even life, to the three of them. This
time she went farther afield than before, beyond
where she had found John Herrick, along
the ledge to a spur of rock where she had
guessed a good growth of underbrush might
be found in the sheltered hollow. She found
that her surmise was correct and harvested a
generous fagot of dry brush and some heavier
branches. Then she scrambled further along
the slope, where a dry, stunted little tree held
up its dead and twisted arms against the sky.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Its trunk will burn famously,” she told herself,
perhaps to quiet any misgivings she felt
concerning the treacherous ground over which
she must pass. Bracing herself, she swung the
short-handled ax and cut deep into the wood.
Once she struck, and again, then heard the preliminary
crack that signaled the surrender of
the tough old tree. She leaned forward for
the last blow—and felt the ground crumble under
foot so that she lost her balance and fell.
Over and over she rolled, down a long slope
of sharp stones that cut her hands and bruised
her face, offering no support as, with outstretched
hands, she snatched at any hold that
would stop her fall.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little juniper bush, whose branch caught
her dress and to whose roots she clung with
bleeding, frantic hands, held her at last. Beyond,
in a great well of shadows, she could
peer down and down, but could see nothing beneath
her, could only hear the tinkle of the ax
as it struck a stone far below. She shuddered
as she looked into that dusky emptiness, then
resolutely turned away and clambered up the
slope.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Though how I managed it,” she confessed
to Nancy some time afterward, “I simply
couldn’t tell you. When I rolled down the
hill, my heart seemed to be rolling over and
over, too, inside me, and it was still doing it
all the time I was crawling up again. The
stones slipped under my feet, and every bush
I took hold of seemed to give way in my hand.
It was only because I had to get back to you
that I ever scrambled up again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet when she reached the steadier footing
of the trail, she saw the dead tree that had been
the cause of her undoing, and setting her
teeth, climbed out once more, inch by inch,
gave the half-severed trunk a jerk, and
brought it away in triumph. She had almost
more than she could carry, and her heart was
beating fast as she struggled up the path once
more, warm, excited, and happy.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought you were never coming back,”
said Nancy anxiously. She was kneeling by
the fire, stirring something in a tin cup.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I—I went further than I intended,” Beatrice
answered and, for the moment, offered
no more extensive report of her adventure.
When she went into the tent, however John
Herrick opened his eyes to look at her with
troubled questioning.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Where have you been so long?” he asked.
“Nancy would not tell me, so I know it was
something unsafe.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was just cutting some brush for the
fire,” she returned cheerfully. “I took your
ax and I—I didn’t bring it back with me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His observant blue eyes went over her from
head to foot, and his face, drawn with pain
though it was, wrinkled to a smile. He did
not overlook, as Nancy had done, her damaged
skirt and her bleeding knuckles. When he
spoke it was so low that she had to stoop down
to hear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Have I not enough to blame myself for,
without having to see some terrible thing happen
to you here on this cruel mountain? I
am proud that you belong to me, you and that
blessed, warm-hearted Nancy. Can you ever
forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Forgive you for what?” she asked protestingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>“For all that I have done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy came in at this moment, carrying
something very carefully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Christina told me that when people camp
in the snow,” she said, “they warm their beds
with hot stones, so I have raked some out of
the fire, nice, flat ones, piping hot.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She packed them in among the blankets with
the deftness of a trained nurse, for Nancy was
possessed, by nature, of a comforting touch.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I am better now,” he declared, trying to
smile reassuringly upon them both, although
the color of his face, ghastly white under the
sunburn, belied his words. “I want you to
sit down and tell me—” his voice faltered, but
in a moment he went on again—“and tell me
about Anna. Is she getting well? How long
has she been ill? Did she really come here to—to——”</p>

<p class='c004'>His voice trailed away to a gasping whisper,
but Beatrice knew what he wished to ask.</p>

<p class='c004'>“She came to find you,” she answered.
“You shall hear all about it. No, don’t move;
it will make your arm begin to bleed again.
Lie still and we will tell you everything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>With the wind howling over their heads,
but with the slow heat of the fire keeping the
worst of the cold at bay, they sat there by him
and told the whole of their tale. Sometimes
one of them would get up to throw some more
fuel upon the flame and the other would take
up the story in the interval. Now and then
he would ask a half-audible question, but
mostly he lay quite quiet, his steady eyes—how
like they were to Aunt Anna’s!—fixed
upon the face of the girl who was speaking.
When the account was finished, he had various
things to ask, often with long pauses for rest
between the words.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you live in the same house—it was the
one where your father and Anna and I were
born? Does Bridget Flynn still stay with
you? Which of you sleeps in the blue room
where on stormy nights you can hear the rain
in the big chimney?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Yes, they lived in the house he knew. Bridget
Flynn, the old nurse who had cared for
them all, was not with them but was still alive.
Beatrice had the big south room—it was green
now,—but the rain in the chimney was just the
same.</p>

<p class='c004'>“How it does come back!” he said at last
with a sigh; “and to think that I have been
such a fool as to believe that I could put all
that I loved so much behind me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His voice failed after that and his questions
ceased. They could hear his faint breathing
and feel the thin, uneven pulse in his wrist, but
he did not move or give other sign of life. The
night had closed about them, the storm was
still blowing louder, and the cold growing
more intense. Snow was piling about the
tent, eddying through the opening, lying in
white drifts even among the folds of the
blankets.</p>

<p class='c004'>They crept back to the fire at last, both of
them wondering miserably at the heaviness of
his stupor, but trying to assure themselves that
it was really sleep. Very closely they huddled
together, sharing the single blanket that was
wrapped about them, saying very little but
thinking very much.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Aunt Anna will be going to bed now,”
Nancy observed, after such long quiet that
Beatrice had thought she was nodding.
“Christina will be lighting the lamps and tucking
in the fur rugs on the sleeping-porch.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Since Beatrice scarcely answered, but sat
staring, though with unseeing eyes, at the red
coals, Nancy spoke again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Are you cold, Beatrice? Are you afraid?
How soon do you think help will come?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“It will come soon,” her sister answered confidently.
“No, I am not cold, and I am not
afraid.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy, willing to be reassured, crept closer
and allowed her heavy eyelids, weighed down
by drowsiness, to fall lower and lower. Beatrice,
however, sat erect and wide awake. She
was counting the number of hours before Dr.
Minturn could get her message, calculating the
time their fuel would last. By midnight the
final log would be burned, the last bundle of
brush would have gone up in windswept
sparks. And what was to come when the fire
was dead?</p>

<p class='c004'>She felt strangely quiet in spite of all the
dread possibilities before her. She thought
over, one by one, all the events in that long,
twisted chain of circumstances that had
brought her here, and realized all that she had
learned, how much she had changed. Could
it be possible that she had once been so absorbed
in her own affairs, in the pleasures and
interests of her single, restricted circle, as to
have been blind to her father’s anxiety and to
Aunt Anna’s slowly breaking heart? She had
left behind, also, that restless discontent and
nameless dissatisfaction that used suddenly to
spring up in the midst of the careless happiness
of the old life. Even when they first
came to live in the cabin she had been filled
with anxiety and the weight of unfamiliar responsibility,
but such misgivings had disappeared
also, blown completely away into the
past by the winds of Gray Cloud Mountain.
Here she had learned new things, had felt new
strength, had begun to play a part in the real
affairs of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nancy, leaning against her, had dropped
sound asleep and Beatrice herself dozed at
last. Her last clear thought had been of Dabney
Mills. Even the puzzle of his suspicions
would be solved, she felt sure. But why had
he thought——?</p>

<p class='c004'>Her eyes closed and opened again with a
start upon a different world. She could not
tell how long a time had passed. The storm
was over, the moon was up and the whole
mountain-side was bathed in light. Leaning
forward, she attempted to look down into the
valley and was surprised to see no valley there.
A level floor of clouds, as smooth as the surface
of a lake, but of a strange, shadowy whiteness
that no water could ever show, lay below
her, a flood of mist that filled Broken Bow
Valley to the brim. Fascinated, she sat
watching, while the moonlight grew clearer
and the soft white turned to glistening silver.
Although she thought herself awake, she dozed
again, for she had a dim idea that she could
walk forth on the smooth level of that white
floor, past the mountain tops, straight away toward
the moon, while all the time another self
sat cold and nodding by the fire, feeding the
failing flame mechanically, with one arm
around the slumbering Nancy. Vaguely she
knew that complete oblivion would mean the
end of the fire, the quenching of the warmth
that kept them alive and of the light that was
to be a signal to their rescuers.</p>

<p class='c004'>How she longed to lay down her head and
give herself up to slumber! How far away
her dream was carrying her, out across that
white sea whose further edge seemed to roll
across the peaks and break against the stars!
Some inward spirit kept her faithful to her
task, even after real consciousness had vanished.
When she did give up to heavy slumber
it was only when her work was done, when
her drowsy ears heard afar the chink of iron
hoofs upon the trail, heard the scrambling of
feet and the sound of men’s voices coming
nearer.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are coming; they see us,” she thought,
and her head dropped upon her arm in absolute
exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c004'>It must have been only for a moment that
she slept, although it seemed that hours must
have passed when she awoke with a jump to a
bewildered confusion of sights and sounds.
The red light of a lantern was flashing in her
face, the huge, grotesque shadow of a horse’s
head danced back and forth on the rock wall
beside her, and Dr. Minturn’s voice sounded
in her ear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Beatrice, are you safe? Are you alive?”</p>

<p class='c004'>Dazzled and confused, she rubbed her eyes,
then motioned toward the tent where John
Herrick lay, since words of explanation would
not come quickly enough. She held her
breath, so it seemed to her, through all the
minutes that the doctor was bending to examine
the unconscious man. When he
straightened up again to speak to her, how
comforting it was to hear that big voice booming
out where the last sound had been John
Herrick’s failing whisper!</p>

<p class='c004'>“He has gone a long way,” the old doctor
said, “but please heaven, we’ll bring him back
again.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XIV <br /> HASTY WORDS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In the gray light that is the ghost of morning,
a fantastic procession went slowly
down the headlong slope of Dead Man’s Mile.
The tall doctor strode ahead with his swinging
lantern, and behind him came the two men he
had brought, carrying John Herrick between
them upon a litter of blankets. Nancy, following
them clung fast to her pommel and was
glad the saddle was so deep that she could not
well fall out of it, no matter how much the doctor’s
pony, upon which she was mounted,
swayed and slid down the path. For guidance,
he was left almost as much to himself as
was the extra horse following at the end of the
line, whose nose was so close to the tail of the
pony that Beatrice rode, and whose footsteps
were guided by the second lantern that bobbed
and jerked from her saddle-bow.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was the next thing to impossible to climb
up in bright daylight,” Beatrice thought.
“How can we ever go down in the dark, with
a helpless person to carry?”</p>

<p class='c004'>But the doctor had declared that further
delay meant too much danger to John Herrick,
and that the attempt must be made.
Down they went, past the rocky shelf where
the girls had found him, past the dizzy precipice
where Beatrice had dropped the ax and
had so nearly followed it, over barriers that
looked impassable, down steep declivities that
were nothing but wells of blackness and hidden
danger. A word of direction from the doctor,
a breathless squeak from Nancy once when
her horse lurched suddenly beneath her, the
steady scuffle of the ponies’ feet—those were
the only sounds. They had passed the icy
shallows of the tumbling stream, they had
looped over the jutting shoulder of smooth
rock where there was scarcely a foothold: there
was a long, stiff-legged jump for each pony,
and they were down.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through the rustling underbrush of the
lower slope, the main trail leading downward
from Gray Cloud Pass was firm under their
feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Looks like Broadway, don’t it, after that
squirrel track back yonder?” observed one of
the men, as they stopped to rest for a little.
The other man went to catch Nancy’s pony
which had been turned loose before the storm
and which now came, stamping and snorting,
through the dark, drawn by the lantern light
and by the desire for company of its own kind.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was possible to carry the litter between
two horses now, so that the doctor mounted,
left one man to follow on foot, and ordered
them all to press forward. A moving shadow
in the darkness proved to be John Herrick’s
black mare, who had managed to scramble
to her feet and stood, with head drooping and
one leg helpless, beside the path.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We can’t stop for her now,” the doctor
said. “I will send some one back to see if
there is anything to be done.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The poor creature was left behind, although
Beatrice leaned from her saddle to touch the
soft anxious nose that was thrust out to her,
and although a pleading whinny could be
heard long after the darkness had swallowed
up the suffering pony.</p>

<p class='c004'>They went on steadily and quickly now,
with Beatrice nodding in her saddle from unbelievable
weariness. They were fording a
stream; they were threading the grove of
aspen-trees; they had reached the last mile of
their journey. The whispering leaves were
all speaking together in the morning breeze;
the birds were beginning to sing; the darkness
had faded so that the light of Beatrice’s lantern
had shrunk to the pale ghost of a flame.
She looked back to see the bare granite slope
above her turn from gray to rose, and to see
the stark summit of Gray Cloud Mountain
shine in sudden silver radiance as the sunrise
touched it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Almost immediately she saw the men ahead
of her stop, dismount, and lean over the litter.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is awake, and I think he wants you,”
one of them said to Nancy, but she listened
and shook her head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is not really conscious,” she answered,
“and it is my Aunt Anna that he is asking
for.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a week, a dragging, interminable
week, before any one was able to know just
what were to be the results of that fateful expedition
up the slopes of Gray Cloud Mountain.
Nancy, stiff and aching in every muscle
from so much unwonted riding, was the first to
recover and to set about her housekeeping.
Beatrice had sprained her knee in that perilous
moment when she dropped the ax over
the mountain-side, but she had scarcely noticed
the mishap until, slipping from the saddle at
her own door, she found herself unable to
walk into the house. For three days she was
almost helpless; by the end of seven, however,
she was able to get about and help Nancy and
Christina with their work.</p>

<p class='c004'>Christina had come to stay at the cabin so
that the girls might not be alone, for Aunt
Anna had moved to John Herrick’s house.
It seemed at first that she had found her
brother only in time to part with him again,
for through four terrible days he lay so ill
that not even Dr. Minturn could have much
hope. Perhaps no one knew until that dreadful
time how brave Aunt Anna could be. It
was she who was cheerful; it was she who was
hopeful and kept up the courage of the others;
it was her tired, white, but smiling face upon
which John Herrick’s eyes first fell when he
opened them to consciousness again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The three girls were standing in the door
and Dr. Minturn was with them, but it was
only his sister that John Herrick saw.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Anna,” he said, “I have had a bad dream,
I think.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” she nodded gravely. “We have all
been dreaming, but at last we are all awake.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His eyes went to the window where, in the
hot sun of brilliant noonday, the moving tree-tops
showed their densest green and the far
mountains stood blue against a bluer sky.
He looked doubtful for a moment, as though
he had expected to find himself in his old home,
in that room where the rain in the chimney had
lulled him to sleep through childhood nights.
When he remembered all that had happened
since, would he shrink away again into that isolation
he had made for himself? They could
actually see, from the changes in his face, just
how the flood of memories rose and swept over
him, recalling everything, from his accident on
the hill back to that day when he had vowed
to shut the door of home behind him forever.
At last he turned to his sister again and smiled.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I thought I could never forgive all of
you,” he said, “and it was you, this whole long
time, who should have forgiven me. Through
all these years I have been remembering how
I went away, how I looked into that row of
serious faces, and thought I read doubt in
every one of them. Yes, Anna dear, I know
you believed in me still; I know you called
after me; but I vowed it was too late. I heard
your voice as I closed the door: it has followed
me ever since, but I would not listen. Can
you forgive me?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The girls slipped away and Dr. Minturn
closed the door.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He’ll do,” he said gruffly. “He won’t
need any of us to cure him now.”</p>

<p class='c004'>A man who has spent the last ten years in
the free open and the bracing air of the Rocky
Mountains does not linger long upon a sick
bed when once he has begun to recover. John
Herrick was sitting up in a week’s time and
was able to limp about the house at the end
of ten days. As his strength grew, so did
Aunt Anna’s, so that step by step they came
along the road of health together.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Isn’t she wearing herself out nursing
him?” Beatrice asked Dr. Minturn anxiously,
but he only laughed.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It never harms people to do what they like
most in the world,” he answered. “I can
hardly tell which of the two is getting well the
faster. They have no further need for me,
so I will be getting back to Miriam. I can
leave the whole affair in your capable hands,
Miss Beatrice.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice laughed, yet flushed with pleasure
that the doctor should voice such confidence
in her. She could not help feeling a little
thrill of pride when she thought how well
things were turning out. Even the black mare
was hobbling about the corral, giving promise
that she could be ridden almost as soon as
John Herrick would be able to mount her.
There was still the affair in the village to be
made clear, but of that Beatrice had thought
very little lately, and not at all of Dabney
Mills.</p>

<p class='c004'>A growing restlessness on Christina’s part
was the first reminder of what was going on
about them.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t want to go,” she explained when,
on Aunt Anna’s returning to the cabin,
Christina announced that she was needed at
home; “but I am anxious when I am away
from Thorvik. I never know what new things
he is thinking up.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She had waited to wash the evening dishes,
lingering over them as though she were unwilling
to finish, but she had said a reluctant
good-by at last and had gone away down the
hill. Beatrice sat on the doorstep looking
after her, and lingered long after she was gone,
watching the darkness deepen between the
tree trunks, and the fireflies moving to and fro.
It had been an over-busy day with the result
that she was very tired. It was surely the
worst possible moment that Dabney Mills
could have chosen to come striding through
the dark, whistling with irritating shrillness.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There are all sorts of rumors about John
Herrick’s being hurt,” he began at once, “so
I came up to see if I could get the real facts.
I tried to interview the old doctor when he
was down in the village, but I didn’t have
much satisfaction. Now, you will have no objection
to telling me a few things, I feel sure.”</p>

<p class='c004'>On that very spot, Beatrice thought, he had
been told once, twice, it was difficult to say
how many times, that his presence was unwelcome
and that he would be told nothing.
Yet here he was again, as inquisitive and as
well-assured of success as ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I don’t see why you keep coming and asking
things,” she said irritably, “when we never
tell you anything.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“A fellow can never tell,” he replied easily,
“where he can pick up a few facts, even in the
most unlikely places. I won’t say this is a
very hopeful one, but there’s nowhere else to
go. I hear your aunt has been nursing Herrick.
Now I could make something very interesting
out of that.”</p>

<p class='c004'>His insinuating grin, half visible in the
dark, was quite beyond bearing.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why shouldn’t she be nursing him when
she is his own sister?” she cried hotly, a sudden
burst of temper driving her quite beyond the
bounds of prudence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dabney’s mouth opened to speak, but no
words came—only at last a long whistle of
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Sister!” he ejaculated; then repeated it to
himself, “Sister!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice said nothing, for she began to have
an uneasy feeling that harm might come from
her hasty speech.</p>

<p class='c004'>“But look-a-here,” Dabney Mills burst out,
“if she’s his sister and he’s your uncle, why
did you never let on to any one? You were
strangers to him, you two girls, when you came
here: I could swear it. And one day when
you were out, I asked your aunt if she had
ever seen John Herrick, and she said no.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Still Beatrice was silent, with growing misgivings,
as he went on excitedly, as much to
himself as to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“There must have been a family quarrel,”
he speculated shrewdly. “Herrick did something
disgraceful, most likely, back there at
home, and came West to lose himself, and the
rest of you followed, by and by, to see him;
but you never owned he belonged to you.
Say, that’s something to tell them down yonder
at the meeting to-night. When they hear
that about his past, they may know for sure
where to look for their money.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He swung on his heel and was off in haste
down the hill.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Stop! Stop!” cried Beatrice, but he paid
no heed. She ran a few steps after him but
he had already disappeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>As she went into the house, she was thinking
of that boulder that had rolled from under
her horse’s feet on the climb up Dead Man’s
Mile. She remembered how it bounded down
the slope, disappearing in the wood to do what
damage she could not tell. In much the same
way her thoughtless speech had escaped from
her and now, quite beyond her reach, was
doing harm at which she could only guess.</p>

<p class='c004'>They all retired early that night, for Aunt
Anna, who had just come home, was tired as
well as happy, and Nancy had been so busy
that she could not hold her eyes open even
until a decent hour for bedtime. In spite of
her uneasy thoughts, Beatrice fell asleep
quickly, and, even after an hour of sound slumber,
awoke with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It is raining,” she thought sleepily at first,
hearing a light tap, tap against the casement.
“I must get up and close the window.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet she would have dropped asleep again
had not the sound continued insistently. She
rubbed the sleep from her eyes and sat up.
To her surprise, the stars were shining through
the window, and no raindrops but a handful
of gravel pattered on the sill. She jumped
up, drew her big coat about her, for the
night air was cold, and leaned out. A shadowy
figure, unrecognizable in the starlight,
stood below her.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Miss Deems,” came a voice, a rich Irish
voice that after a moment of doubt she realized
was Dan O’Leary’s, the man who used to care
for Buck; “Miss Deems, there’s the deuce and
all to pay down in the town to-night, and this
Dabney Mills here vows that it was your
doing.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She discerned then a second figure skulking
among the shadows, a very crestfallen Dabney
Mills, brought hither evidently by no desire
of his own.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He came to the meeting,” went on Dan,
“and gave us a long tale of how John Herrick’s
past had come out at last, how he had
got into disgrace back East and came here
to lose himself and take another name. And
from that he argues that it was John Herrick
took the money we have all been looking for
this long time. I thought it only best to come
straight to you for the truth, since the fellow
here was quoting you.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Poor Beatrice’s teeth chattered with cold
and misery as she leaned against the window-frame
and, below her breath, tried to explain
just how matters stood. Had Aunt Anna
been wakeful, she would have been reading in
the room below and would have overheard, but
fortunately she was sleeping soundly on the
sleeping-porch at the other side of the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Some of what he said is half true,” Beatrice
began, “and some of it is all false.” Dan
O’Leary listened to the end of her story without
comment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I was hoping you could give him the lie
direct,” he said finally. “The men below are
wild with anger and are coming up the hill
to tax John Herrick with wrecking the company.
They were walking and we had horses,
but they’ll not be so long behind us. Well,
I’ll go back and stop them if I can.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Couldn’t you—couldn’t you go up the hill
and warn him?” Beatrice asked desperately.</p>

<p class='c004'>“No, they’d call me traitor if I did, for,
though I’m a good friend to John Herrick,
after all I’m one with those below and
pledged to help them. We’ll be going back
now. I’ll do the best I can. Here,” to Dabney,
“get on your horse and come along. It’s
just such know-nothings as you that let loose
most of the mischief in the world.”</p>

<p class='c004'>After they had gone, Beatrice still stood,
clinging to the window-frame, stunned and
bewildered. This, then, was the result of her
angry words; this was the mischief that she
had set on foot. What could she do to make
amends? She did not have to think long, but
she turned from the window with a sigh that
was nearer a groan. She must lay the whole
matter before John Herrick, tell him the
real truth of what she had said and what had
been the result. He could never forgive her;
of that she felt sure. She had put an end,
all in a minute, to that new-found trust and
friendliness that had been so hardly won.
Yet it was the only thing to do.</p>

<p class='c004'>Buck, who had been brought home a week
before, sprang up from his straw bed at the
sound of his mistress’s footsteps. He submitted,
for once, to being saddled without protest,
as though he had been too full of curiosity
concerning this strange night adventure to
make any delay.</p>

<p class='c004'>Down the path to the gate they made their
way, then up the trail as fast as Buck could
be urged, with Beatrice’s head turned over her
shoulder to peer down at the town below.
One building was brilliantly lighted—the hall
where the men’s meetings were held. There
were lights in many of the houses, too, although
it was so nearly midnight. Then, carried by
the chill wind that blew up from the valley,
came the far-off sound of shouting voices from
the throng of angry men who were marching
up the trail.</p>

<p class='c004'>John Herrick’s house was alight also, for
he was a person of late hours. She could see,
as she came near, that he was sitting by the
big table in the living-room and that Hester
was nodding over a book in the chair beside
him. Since he was up and about again, she
seemed unwilling to leave him for a moment.
Beatrice knocked, but could not wait for an
answer and burst in upon them, beginning to
pour out her story before she was half-way
across the room.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hester, starting up, listened in frank bewilderment,
but the expression on John Herrick’s
face was quite different. Her tale was
none too plain, but he seemed to guess, long
before she had finished, what it was she was
trying to say.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Tell me,” he said at last when she paused;
“tell me one thing.” Her heart sank, for his
eyes were hard and his tone was harsh and dry.
“Why did you come here? Was it to warn
me, so that I could go away?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Oh, no, no,” she gasped, still breathless
and incoherent. “I only felt that you ought
to know what harm I had done. I wanted
you to be ready to explain to the men when
they came that it was I who had——”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Do you mean,” he interrupted her, leaning
forward in his chair, his eyes fixed on her
with a strange, intense eagerness; “do you
mean that you do not believe as they do?
That you don’t suspect me of stealing that
money?”</p>

<p class='c004'>The blank astonishment on Beatrice’s face
was answer enough.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It wouldn’t be possible!” she declared
simply.</p>

<p class='c004'>He leaned back, and put his hand over his
face as though suddenly weary.</p>

<p class='c004'>“God bless you, Beatrice,” he said. “I will
remember that always, that you believed in
me.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He rose slowly, limped across the room, and
opened the door of a safe, let into the wall
between two bookcases. He brought out two
steel boxes, and set them on the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Now go and open the doors,” he said, “so
that when our friends arrive, they can come
in at once.”</p>

<p class='c004'>While he unlocked the boxes, Hester went
to do as he had directed; but Beatrice, wondering
and fascinated, could not leave his side.
The first lid that he lifted showed bundles of
bank-notes, and the second, shining piles of
heavy gold pieces.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes, this is the money that was missing,”
he said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER XV <br /> A SONG FROM OVER THE SEA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>For a little time there was no sound in
the big room as Beatrice stood gazing
in open-mouthed astonishment at the piles of
gold and silver pieces heaped upon the table,
while Hester stood at the outer door to listen.
The night sounds of the mountain came in:
the wind among the trees, the squeaking of a
bat, the far-off yelp of a coyote. Presently,
however, these faint noises were drowned in
another, distant but growing nearer and
louder, the angry voices of excited men and
the tramp of feet upon the road.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice went to the door beside Hester and,
for what seemed a very long time, stood waiting
without a word spoken by any one of them,
so intently were they all listening. Much as
Beatrice desired that John Herrick should explain
the presence of that money upon the
table, she dreaded his speaking, for she wished
to lose no sound of the tumult that was coming
ever nearer up the hill.</p>

<p class='c004'>The crowd of men was in sight now, climbing
the last rise of the trail. They were singing
some wild foreign song: it might have been
Russian, Polish, Hungarian; she knew not
which. The words conveyed no meaning to
her, but the loud harsh cadences seemed to cry
out a message of their own: a song of blind tyrannies
and passionate rebellion, of cracking
whips and pistol-shots, of villages burning
amid curses and weeping and the cries of children.
She shivered with terror as the shouting
voices came close.</p>

<p class='c004'>“If only they were Americans,” she whispered
to Hester. How could any one control
such a mob which scarcely understood a
common tongue?</p>

<p class='c004'>“There is no knowing what they may do,”
Hester whispered in answer, “but if any one
is able to quiet them, Roddy can.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The men came tramping up to the foot of
the veranda steps and stopped—a dense, huddled
throng with a tossing lantern carried here
and there that showed the dark faces and the
shining, excited eyes. A few figures stood
out against the foreign backgrounds: a handful
of American and Irish laborers, Dan
O’Leary, head and shoulders taller than the
others, Dabney Mills hovering on the outskirts
of the group, talking incessantly and entirely
unheeded.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thorvik stood on the lowest step, his back
to them, bareheaded and pouring out a stream
of eloquence. Two or three men stepped up
to him and began an earnest discussion, which
waxed hotter and hotter as the minutes passed,
as the crowd quieted, and as all stood waiting.
Dabney Mills joined them, shaking his head
and protesting vehemently. Beatrice, leaning
forward, caught enough of the broken
English to understand the meaning of their
hesitation. They were arguing as to which
should go in first. Inside a great sum of
money was spread out upon the table, with no
one to guard it but an injured man and two
girls, yet these disturbers of the night’s peace
were quarreling as to who should enter first.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was Dan O’Leary who pushed through
the crowd finally and strode up the steps.
The girls turned to watch him cross the hall
and stop before the table where John Herrick
sat unmoving.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Well, boss,” the Irishman said simply,
“how about it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>John Herrick’s thin face relaxed into a
smile.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Why don’t your friends come in?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They’re a bit shy,” Dan admitted. “I
hear them talking it over how you can shoot
straighter than any other man in Broken Bow
County.”</p>

<p class='c004'>John Herrick’s smile grew broader and he
got to his feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then I suppose I must go out to them,”
he said, “if they won’t come in.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He limped slowly across the hall and out
upon the steps, while a great roar went up
from the men as he appeared.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The money of which there has been so much
talk is in there on my table. Is there any
man who cares to come in to count it?”</p>

<p class='c004'>There was no answer, nor did any one come
forward. Thorvik, hurrying from one to another,
whispering, pointing, urging, seemed to
have no influence at all. Dabney Mills, shrill
and abusive, shouted something from the back
of the crowd, but no one moved. Dan
O’Leary burst into a great roar of laughter
and slapped his knee.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You should have heard them tell, on the
way up the mountain, what they were going
to do,” he declared to Beatrice at whose side
he was standing. “Thorvik and Mills, why,
they were breathing fire, and now look at
them.” He stepped forward and stood by
John Herrick. “Boys,” he said, “I’m
through. I came up here with you to ask the
boss a question, to find out if he had got away
with any of the Irrigation Company’s funds.
Well, I don’t care any more to ask it. I know
he’s all right.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice turned at a sound behind her and
saw Olaf, followed by old Julia and Tim,
come pushing through the door in the hall
within. The man and the woman were both
deaf and the boy slept in one of the outbuildings,
so that they had only just now been
awakened by the noise. Olaf’s eye was fixed
unwaveringly upon Thorvik, and that worthy,
suddenly becoming aware of the fact began to
sidle away into the background and disappeared
behind the bulk of a gigantic Slovak.
Beatrice laid a restraining hand on Olaf’s arm,
for John Herrick was speaking again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You shall have an explanation,” he began,
“though I have been waiting for you to understand
of yourselves. While you were talking
up your strike, or rather while your leader
was talking and you were listening, the Irrigation
Company was coming to the end of its
funds. Why? Because, after your valuable
Thorvik came to this camp, construction
dragged, no man did a full day’s work any
more, time and material and money were being
wasted until the whole enterprise was at the
edge of disaster. Was it easy to raise more
capital, do you think, when the whole place
was seething with discontent and everybody
knew that a strike was coming? No, the men
who had put money into the project, far from
being willing to subscribe more, were wishing
they could withdraw. It came about that we
moved first, and shut down the work the very
night that you were ready to declare a strike.
It was a good thing for both sides. We all
needed a little time to think things over.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He paused, as though for comment from his
audience, but no one spoke and he went on
again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“While you have been—resting, I have been
working, and I have managed to arrange for
enough capital to carry on the work to the end,
on one condition. When things are not to
your liking, you are to use the good American
way of talking things over and settling them
peaceably, not the method you brought with
you from over the sea, of rioting and burning
and stirring up hatred between one man and
another. On that basis we can go on. In a
crisis like this it is always easiest to blame one
man, and you have chosen to blame me. What
you have been saying about me I neither know
nor care, but if you had used your own wits
instead of Thorvik’s, you would have seen how
things really stood. And I will tell you this.
Through all this time of waiting, I have kept
in my safe a sufficient sum in cash for immediate
use, so that when the time came to begin
again, we could go forward without a day’s,
without an hour’s delay. It is there, as I said,
ready for you to earn it. And now have you
had enough of Thorvik and his talk of revolutions?
Do you want to go back to work?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“We want to go back,” shouted a voice from
the crowd.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was an American voice, but its refrain
was taken up in a dozen foreign tongues.
Yes, it was plain that they were weary of their
leader and that they wished to work again.</p>

<p class='c004'>“Then go home and get some sleep and we
will start work in the morning,” John Herrick
said. “The money will be there to pay your
next week’s wages and there will be enough
for one thing besides. It will buy your precious
Thorvik a ticket back to his own country
and we will all see that he makes use of it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>“But—see here,” Dabney Mills’ querulous
voice rose above the murmur of approval,
“I’ve be telling them——”</p>

<p class='c004'>Then it was that Beatrice had the greatest
surprise of all her life. She suddenly found
herself standing on the step beside John Herrick,
telling what had happened, making plain
to that strange, listening group, what was the
source of Dabney’s story. With her hand
holding to her uncle’s, she spoke out bravely
and told the whole truth—just what had really
occurred and just how the reporter had spied
and listened and questioned and put together
his so-called facts. She even found herself
at the end, telling of Dabney’s inglorious encounter
with the bear.</p>

<div id='i290'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/illus-290.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>Beatrice found herself telling what had happened</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Although the men did not understand much
English, her speech was so direct that they
could easily comprehend the greater part of it.
When she came to the story of the bear, such
a shout of laughter went up that it drowned
what little more she might have wished to say.
The men slapped each other on the shoulder,
told the story all over again to one another in
their own tongues, rocked and chuckled and
burst forth again and again in uproarious
mirth. It seemed to touch the sense of humor
of every one of them that the strutting, vainglorious
young reporter should have been the
hero of such an ignominious adventure. When
the gale of merriment had somewhat laughed
itself out, Dan O’Leary’s voice could be heard
above the others.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We don’t need any more proof that they
belong to each other,” he said. “The pluck
of the little one and the pluck of the big one,
they sure come from the same stock. And
now let’s be getting back and be ready for
work in the morning. We needn’t spend our
time waiting for Sherlock Holmes. He has
gone on ahead, and another of our friends with
him.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Under cover of the noisy laughter, two people
had quietly slipped away. A pair of shadows
flitting down the trail, a slim one and a
sturdy one, were the last that Beatrice ever
saw of Dabney Mills and of Thorvik.</p>

<p class='c004'>The crowd dispersed, and went trudging
down the mountainside, as John Herrick had
advised, to sleep in preparation for the work
next day. Their voices and laughter could
be heard from afar as they wound down the
path—a cheery, comforting sound after the
angry shouts and that wild, terrible song that
had heralded their coming. Beatrice, standing
to look after them, felt a sudden wave of
friendliness and good-will for the whole company,
which, a short time before, she had regarded
with such terror and repulsion.</p>

<p class='c004'>She went in at last to talk the whole matter
over with John Herrick and Hester and Olaf
and Dan O’Leary, who had stayed behind.
They heard the whole tale, not only of the irrigation
project, but of all that had led up
to it. The story was of a man beginning with
nothing and in ten years gathering the fortune
that he was now putting into the watering of
the valley. It was wealth reaped from the
fertile, untried resources and the open-handed
opportunities of a new country. The valley
was in the hands of prospectors and homesteaders
when he came. He had seen the
mines opened, the farms plowed from virgin
soil, the wilderness changed to a settled
country. After the pioneers and the farmers,
had come the crowd of foreign laborers, to
build the railroads, to pick the fruit, to rear
the houses and dig the irrigation ditches.</p>

<p class='c004'>“They are a blight on the country,” said
Olaf, but John Herrick shook his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We need them,” he insisted. “We have to
help them and teach them; and their children
will be good Americans. There are a few
like Thorvik who will cause trouble to the end
of the chapter, but we can make something of
the rest of them.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was the mountain above them that alone
had not changed, he went on to tell them, although
it was the mountain that had made the
valley what it was. It had given its treasures
of gold and silver, the timber and pasturage of
its lower slopes; its roaring streams watered
the fields and the valley was fertile with soil
washed from its rocky shoulders.</p>

<p class='c004'>“A good part of the mountain belongs to
me,” John Herrick said, “and a bit of it to
Beatrice, too. I can go higher and higher,
blasting its rocks, cutting its trees, but at a
certain point I have to stop. There is no man
yet who has conquered the wind and clouds
and cold of the summit, and Gray Cloud
Mountain is still master of us all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When at last he ceased talking, it was only
because Hester had dropped asleep in her
chair and the gray dawn was showing behind
the windows. Beatrice was still listening
eagerly, and so was Olaf, who heaved a long
sigh as the story came to an end.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I wish I were going to do things like that,”
he said wistfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>“You are,” returned John Herrick, “and so
is Beatrice, and Hester, too. There are just
such adventures ahead of all of you, in times
like these: every person who is growing up
now will find his share of strange, new things
to do. Now you must take Beatrice home,
Olaf. You children should not have let me
talk the whole night away.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Dan O’Leary, who had said very little, got
up and held out his hand to Olaf as he said
good-by.</p>

<p class='c004'>“We’ll be glad to see you down in the town,”
he declared. “We’ve got over some things
we used to think about you, and we’ve
learned a great deal this night.”</p>

<p class='c004'>They rode slowly down the hill, and Beatrice
and Olaf turned in at her gate, still discussing
the night’s adventure.</p>

<p class='c004'>“He is a real man, John Herrick is,” was
Olaf’s final verdict as they reached the steps
of the cabin. “You can’t beat him for fairness
or for pluck. And you know, the first time
I saw you, I thought you were like him. I
believe I had begun to understand that you
belonged to each other long before any one
told me so.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She lingered on the steps, watching him lead
Buck away to his stable and then mount his
own horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I ride like a sailor,” he admitted as he
climbed into the saddle, “and—I didn’t tell
you—I am going to sea again next week. My
mother doesn’t like my going but I can’t stop
ashore more than this long. Now that all this
trouble is cleared up, I will go down to stay
with her until I leave. And you will go to see
her sometimes, won’t you, after I am gone?”</p>

<p class='c004'>“Yes,” promised Beatrice, “but we are going
ourselves before very long. I can’t believe the
summer has really passed. Hester is coming
with us to go to the school where Nancy and
I go, and John Herrick—can I ever call him
anything else, I wonder—is coming too. But
in a year we will all be back again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>He rode away, leaving her sitting on the
steps, still wide awake and reluctant to go in.
The cabin was very still, since evidently no
one had awakened to miss her in the hours
that she had been gone. She sat very quietly,
watching the sky grow red between the black
columns of the pine-trees, listening to the soft
thunder of the waterfall and the growing
chorus of the birds as they awoke with the
awakening dawn.</p>

<p class='c004'>An approaching footstep surprised her.
Some one had come very softly up the needle-strewn
pathway while she sat there dreaming.
It was a figure that she did not recognize at
once—a person with outlandish clothes, and a
yellow face, and with two bundles done up in
blue cotton handkerchiefs hung on the pole
upon his shoulder. After a moment of inspection
she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c004'>“Joe Ling!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The Chinaman nodded.</p>

<p class='c004'>“I leave your house because trouble was
coming,” he explained. “Trouble over now,”
he waved his hand toward the village; “I come
back again.”</p>

<p class='c004'>By some secret sense through which Chinamen seem
to know everything, he had got news
of the outbreak in the town almost before it
had occurred and had departed; but now, divining
just as quickly that the difficulty was over,
he had returned. There could be no more convincing
proof that peace and quiet were really
restored in Ely.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beatrice thought for a moment, inclined
at first to send him away. She was beginning
to be more used to the strange ways of Chinamen,
however. “And besides,” she reflected,
“it will not do Nancy and me any harm to
have a vacation from our work for these last
days that we are here.”</p>

<p class='c004'>She nodded to Joe Ling and he made his
way around the corner of the house, to be heard
presently in the kitchen making preparations
for breakfast as easily as though he had been
in residence a twelvemonth.</p>

<p class='c004'>She would soon be going back to all the old
interests, she thought, still without moving—back
to lessons, dances, club meetings. How
far away that had all seemed to be! Everything
would look different to her now. She
would never be discontented again nor wonder
if the future was going to be dull, since she
had once realized how much life can hold.</p>

<p class='c004'>Leaning back against the door-post, she sat
contentedly staring out across the hill. In the
room upstairs Nancy was stirring, for Beatrice
heard the window close. Soon she would have
to go in to relate all that had happened in the
night, but just for a minute more she would
watch the glowing sky, the moving tree-tops
and the peak of Gray Cloud Mountain showing
clear and sharp in the first light of dawn.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
